B A Moussa,N M El Kousy,Two convenient spectrophotometric methods were developed for the determination of hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone. A specific colour reaction for the determination of hydrochlorothiazide is reported. One method is based on the reaction of hydrochlorothiazide with n-butylamine and cobaltous chloride in anhydrous methanol. A blue-violet colour is produced and is measured at 570 nm. A highly selective colorimetric method was adopted for the analysis of spironolactone by reacting with isoniazid forming a coloured hydrazone derivative and subsequent measurement of the coloured product at 405 nm.,2020-04-30T19:30:20.367892,pubmed,2,29626877,483321600,Colorimetric Analysis of some Diuretic Drugs: Hydrochlorothiazide and Spironolactone,79-82,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0167-6555,pharmaceutisch-weekblad-scientific-edition,Pharm Weekbl Sci,Pharmaceutisch Weekblad.

Xian-Hua Zhang,Kin Man Ho,"Air-stable magnetic cobalt nanocrystals have been conveniently prepared via a reverse micellar synthesis, followed by a hydrothermal treatment. The synthesis was carried out by first mixing an aqueous solution containing cobalt chloride and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) with an organic mixture containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to form reverse micelles, followed by reducing cobalt ions with sodium borohydride. The resultant nanoparticles were then undergone a hydrothermal treatment at 165 degrees C for 8 h to generate well-dispersed CTAB/PSS-encapsulated cobalt nanocrystals with an average diameter of 3.5 +/- 0.5 nm. The nanoparticles were highly crystalline with a hexagonal close-packed crystal phase. The presence of CTAB/PSS complex coatings was identified by FT-IR and UV-vis spectroscopies as well as thermogravimetry analyses. The nanocrystals exhibited superparamagnetic property at room temperature with a saturation magnetization (M(s)) of 95 emu/g. The magnetization could be largely preserved after storage at room temperature for 4 months as the M(s) value only slightly decreased to 88 emu/g (measured at 300 K). Thus, the polymer encapsulation could not only improve thermal stability of the micelles for the growth and nucleation of Co atoms but also protect the resulting cobalt nanocrystals from oxidation through forming an oxygen impermeable sheath.",2020-05-02T02:12:46.588233,pubmed,5,44822823,1271721600,Hydrothermal Microemulsion Synthesis of Oxidatively Stable Cobalt Nanocrystals Encapsulated in Surfactant/Polymer Complex Shells,6009-14,8,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0743-7463,langmuir-the-acs-journal-of-surfaces-and-colloids,Langmuir,Langmuir : the Acs Journal of Surfaces and Colloids,1588385566,26,1,Xian-Hua Zhang,2,Kin Man Ho,2010-04-20T00:00:00,1588385566,hydrothermal-microemulsion-synthesis-of-oxidatively-stable-cobalt-nanocrystals-encapsulated-in-surfactant-polymer-complex-shells,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/la9045918,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20337480,2020-05-02T02:12:46.588233,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Ai-Hua Wu,Kin Hung Wong,Pei Li,academic,Asia,HK,Hong Kong,Hkpu,Hk Polyu,Xianggang Ligong Daxue,the-hong-kong-polytechnic-university,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,300,1.209,academic,Asia,HK,Hong Kong,Hkpu,Hk Polyu,Xianggang Ligong Daxue,the-hong-kong-polytechnic-university,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,3,Ai-Hua Wu,4,Kin Hung Wong,TRUE,4269833,Pei Li,pei-li-d595e7c20a494704859f6bfc7c12edf9,5,pei-li-d595e7c20a494704859f6bfc7c12edf9,Pei Li,TRUE,4269833,Pei Li,pei-li-d595e7c20a494704859f6bfc7c12edf9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R De Boer,K Kuller,"House-dust mites are a major source of allergens. Beds are often heavily infested. It is conceivable that, during the winter period in temperate climates, the ambient indoor air is too dry for their survival, but that mites can still survive in beds where the humidity is raised when the bed is occupied. To investigate whether house-dust mites can take advantage of daily episodes with elevated humidity to restore water balance, we exposed mites to spells of high humidity (90% relative humidity [RH]), lasting 0, 1.5, 3, 6, or 12 h, once every day, while the humidity was low (10% RH) during the rest of the time. Survival was markedly promoted when only 1.5 h of moist air per day was given. Three hours of moist air per day allowed the mites to reproduce. The same average humidity but at a constant level would have been lethal to the mites. Thus, average humidity can be misleading as an indicator of mite survival conditions. Measurements of relative humidity were made inside the foam core of a mattress and underneath the ticking. The rise of humidity occurring when the bed was occupied was often insufficient for the mites, because the temperature rose at the same time. At higher temperatures, mites required a higher relative humidity, abolishing the effect of the simultaneous rise in absolute humidity. Thus, it seems quite possible to regulate house-dust mite numbers also in beds by reducing the water content of the ambient air. The rules governing changes in temperature and humidity inside a bed may be simple enough to allow assessment of house-dust mite living conditions by measurements in the ambient air.",2020-05-01T00:17:19.480915,pubmed,2,34059245,857174400,Mattresses as a Winter Refuge for House-Dust Mite Populations,299-305,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0105-4538,allergy,Allergy,Allergy,1588292239,52,1,R De Boer,2,K Kuller,1997-03-01T00:00:00,1588292239,mattresses-as-a-winter-refuge-for-house-dust-mite-populations,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1111/j.1398-9995.1997.tb00994.x,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9140520,2020-05-01T00:17:19.480915,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,University of Amsterdam,Uva,,universiteit-van-amsterdam,Universiteit Van Amsterdam,156,2.459,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,University of Amsterdam,Uva,,universiteit-van-amsterdam,Universiteit Van Amsterdam,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A E Hall,M R Kaufmann,"Leaf resistance of Sesamum indicum L. increased when the humidity gradient between leaf and air was increased, at moderate temperatures, even though calculated carbon dioxide concentrations within the leaf decreased slightly. Mesophyll resistance remained relatively constant when humidity gradients were changed, indicating that the increases in leaf resistance were mainly caused by reductions in stomatal aperture and that nonstomatal aspects of photosynthesis and respiration were not affected. Low carbon dioxide concentrations inside the leaf decreased but did not eliminate resistance response to the humidity gradient. Internal carbon dioxide concentrations had little effect on resistance in humid air but had moderate effects on resistance with large humidity gradients between leaf and air. Stomatal response to humidity was not present at high leaf temperatures. Effects of humidity gradients on photosynthetic and stomatal responses to temperature suggested that large humidity gradients may contribute to mid-day closure of stomata and depressions in photosynthesis.",2020-05-01T17:18:38.825828,pubmed,2,41291572,162864000,Stomatal Response to Environment with Sesamum Indicum.

I M Kolthoff,K Yamashita,"Conditions are described under which the catalytic Brdicka currents observed in ammoniacal buffer solutions containing cobalt(III) hexammine chloride or cobalt(II) and very little bovine-serum albumin (0.1-0.2 muM) are purely kinetically controlled. Under these conditions the kinetic current at pH 9.3-10.3 exhibits a sharp maximum followed by a decrease of the current to a well-defined minimum. The maximum and minimum are eliminated in the presence of 5 mM or more concentrated calcium chloride when a short plateau occurs at the potential of the maximum followed by a well-defined second wave. Both currents are kinetically controlled. When the albumin concentration is 2 muM or greater, the kinetic currents approach diffusion control, the rate of diffusion of cobalt(III) or (II) being close to rate determining. Under these conditions the currents become proportional to the cobalt(III) or (II) concentration in the concentration range between 25 and 200 muM.",2020-05-01T17:24:22.148469,pubmed,4,41453824,110332800,Characteristics of Polarographic Catalytic Waves Observed with Bovine-Serum Albumin: Kinetic or Diffusion Control,2020-4,7,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0027-8424,proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-of-the-united-states-of-america,Proc.

J C Alberdi,J Díaz,"Daily mortality displays a seasonal pattern linked to weather, air pollution, photoperiod length, influenza incidence and diet, among which temperature ranks as a leading cause. This study thus sought to assess the relationship between temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and mortality in the Madrid Autonomous Region (Spain) for the period January 1986-December 1992, controlling for the effects of air pollution and influenza incidence. Daily data on maximum, minimum and 24-hour mean temperature, relative humidity and wind speed were matched against daily mortality. Transfer function was identified using the Box-Jenkins pre-whitening method. Multivariate time series regression models were used to control for the confounding effects of air pollution and influenza incidence. Separate seasonal analyses were carried out for winter and summer periods. A J-shaped relationship between outdoor temperature, relative humidity and daily mortality was found. Mortality proved to be inversely related to cold temperature (4- to 11-day lag) and directly related to warm temperature (1-day lag). High relative humidity during summer periods was negatively related to mortality. Thermal variation ascribable to Madrid's mesothermal Mediterranean climate was strongly related to daily mortality, even where air pollution and influenza incidence were controlled for.",2020-05-01T02:16:47.545708,pubmed,4,34914453,904608000,Daily Mortality in Madrid Community 1986-1992: Relationship with Meteorological Variables,571-8,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0393-2990,european-journal-of-epidemiology,Eur.

C W Miller,T M Shafik,"The insecticide propoxur was applied as 2 non-overlapping bands approximately 1 m wide to the interior of houses in El Salvador once every 35 days for a period of 9 months. Air samples were collected from the interior of the houses once every seventh day during the entire period. In the study area, air temperatures remain relatively constant, while rainfall varies seasonally. It was found that volatilization of propoxur, as determined by the amounts detectable in air, represented release of the chemical from the treated surface and that the volatilization process was most influenced by the amount of moisture present in the air. Higher air concentrations of propoxur occurred during periods of high relative humidity than in periods of low relative humidity. The principles involved in this process and its bearing on the value of propoxur in malaria control programmes are discussed.",2020-04-30T19:43:56.875669,pubmed,2,30054969,126230400,Concentrations of Propoxur in Air Following Repeated Indoor Applications,41-4,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0042-9686,bulletin-of-the-world-health-organization,Bull.

Li-Qiang Chu,Renate Förch,"Optical waveguide spectroscopy (OWS) was employed to monitor the swelling behavior of pulsed plasma polymerized maleic anhydride (PPPMA) films in humid air and in aqueous solutions by measuring the film thicknesses and refractive indices. With the relative humidity of air increasing, both the thickness and the refractive index of the PPPMA films increased, indicating water penetration into and uptake by the films. The swelling of the hydrated PPPMA films in humid air is reversible. In aqueous media, the thickness and the refractive index of the washed PPPMA film increased with an increase of pH and ionic strength, respectively. On the basis of the present data, a hypothesis concerning the structure of the PPPMA film is proposed. Our model suggests that the unique structure of the PPPMA films originates from the cyclic structure of maleic anhydride and depends on parameters of the plasma deposition process, and the interaction between H(2)O and the carboxylic groups.",2020-05-01T17:19:29.491877,pubmed,3,41316696,1142294400,Pulsed Plasma Polymerized Maleic Anhydride Films in Humid Air and in Aqueous Solutions Studied with Optical Waveguide Spectroscopy,2822-6,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0743-7463,langmuir-the-acs-journal-of-surfaces-and-colloids,Langmuir,Langmuir : the Acs Journal of Surfaces and Colloids,1588353569,22,1,Li-Qiang Chu,2,Renate Förch,2006-03-14T00:00:00,1588353569,pulsed-plasma-polymerized-maleic-anhydride-films-in-humid-air-and-in-aqueous-solutions-studied-with-optical-waveguide-spectroscopy,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/la0530283,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,16519489,2020-05-01T17:19:29.491877,,,,,,,,,Wolfgang Knoll,,,,,,,,,,,,300,1.209,,,,,,,,,,3,Wolfgang Knoll,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M L Aitken,J J Marini,"Eight persons with asthma were exposed to seven air conditions varying in temperature (37 degrees C to 49 degrees C [98.6 degrees F to 120.2 degrees F]) and water content (44 mg H2O per liter to 79 mg H2Oper liter) . Normocapnic hyperventilation for three minutes at 40% maximal voluntary ventilation was carried out for each condition. A constant-volume body plethysmograph measured the functional residual capacity and specific airway conductance (SGaw), followed by two forced expiratory manuevers. Measurements were taken before and 1, 5, 10, and 20 minutes after each challenge. Air conditions with 100% relative humidity caused a fall in the SGaw that was maximal in 1 minute. Air conditions at 100% relative humidity caused a greater fall in both the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (P<.05) and the SGaw (P<.005) than did conditions of the same temperature but less water content. At 44 degrees C and 100% relative humidity, the mean percent change in FEV1 and SGaw was -2% and -40%, respectively, at 1 minute after challenge. Of the conditions examined, the optimal temperature was 44 degrees C, and we speculate that the optimal water content is less than 44 mg H2O per liter.

Frank Keppler,Reinhard Borchers,"Vinyl chloride is a highly reactive and toxic substance which is widely used in industry. It is the parent compound of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC), one of the most important industrial polymers. Until now, it was thought that vinyl chloride found in the environment is exclusively man-made or results from the degradation of other anthropogenic substances, such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene. Here, we demonstrate that vinyl chloride also has natural sources. Soil air and ambient air from a rural area in Northern Germany were investigated for volatile chlorinated halocarbons. The concentrations of vinyl chloride in the soil air were significantly enhanced as compared to ambient air, indicating a natural formation of this compound in the soil. A series of laboratory experiments using different soils and model compounds was conducted, which clearly proved that vinyl chloride could be produced during soil processes. We propose that this highly reactive compound can be formed during the oxidative degradation of organic matter in soil, for example, in a reaction between humic substances, chloride ions and an oxidant (ferric ions or hydroxyl radicals). The redox-sensitive aromatic compounds in soil such as catechols and o-quinones can be degraded to CO2, accompanied by the release of vinyl chloride and other volatile chlorinated compounds. This process could have started in the Late Silurian to Early Devonian, 400 million years ago, when the first soils on earth evolved.",2020-05-01T06:29:40.244461,pubmed,5,36727473,1022889600,Natural Formation of Vinyl Chloride in the Terrestrial Environment,2479-83,11,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0013-936X,environmental-science-technology,Environ.

Ten healthy adult men were studied in the presence (8,000-10,000 cm-3) or absence (200-400 cm-3) of negative air ions (25 degrees C, 50% humidity) after 1 h of exercise. The level of exercise was adjusted to represent a 50-60% load compared with the subjects' maximal oxygen uptake, which was determined using a bicycle ergometer in an unmodified environment (22-23 degrees C, 30-35% humidity, 200-400 negative air ions.cm-3). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values during the recovery period were significantly lower in the presence of negative ions than in their absence. The plasma levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were significantly lower in the presence of negative ions than in their absence. These results demonstrated that exposure to negative air ions produced a slow recovery of DBP and decreases in the levels of 5-HT and DA in the recovery period after moderate endurance exercise. 5-HT is thought to have contributed to the slow recovery of DBP.",2020-05-01T02:13:58.024847,pubmed,7,34894469,886291200,The Effect of Exposure to Negative Air Ions on the Recovery of Physiological Responses after Moderate Endurance Exercise,132-6,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0020-7128,international-journal-of-biometeorology,Int J Biometeorol,International Journal of Biometeorology,1588299238,41,1,T Ryushi,2,I Kita,1998-02-01T00:00:00,1588299238,the-effect-of-exposure-to-negative-air-ions-on-the-recovery-of-physiological-responses-after-moderate-endurance-exercise,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9531858,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/s004840050066,2020-05-01T02:13:58.024847,,,,,,,,,T Sakurai,M Yasumatsu,M Isokawa,academic,Asia,JP,Japan,Tokyo Metropolitan University - Minamiosawa Campus,Tokyo Metropolitan University,Tmu,shuto-daigaku-tokyo,Shuto Daigaku Tokyo,78,0.636,academic,Asia,JP,Japan,Tokyo Metropolitan University - Minamiosawa Campus,Tokyo Metropolitan University,Tmu,shuto-daigaku-tokyo,Shuto Daigaku Tokyo,3,T Sakurai,4,M Yasumatsu,,,,,5,,M Isokawa,,,,,,,,,Shuto Daigaku Tokyo - Minamiosawa Campus,Shuto Daigaku Tokyo - Minamiosawa Campus,,,,,,Y Aihara,K Hama,Tokyo Toritsu Daigaku,Tokyo Toritsu Daigaku,6,Y Aihara,7,K Hama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E Gibney,J Gault,The heat shock response has been suggested as a potential biomarker in toxicology. A vast amount of stimuli have been shown to induce heat shock proteins and new techniques to measure the response are constantly being assessed. In this study we use a novel immunocytochemistry technique to measure heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) induction in L929 cells exposed to cadmium chloride. Hsp70 induction was quantifiably measured using a soluble coloured substrate and qualitatively measured using a coloured substrate that precipitated at the location of hsp70. Using the insoluble coloured substrate hsp70 was identified predominantly within the cytoplasm of control cells. At intermediate cadmium concentrations hsp70 was observed to translocate to the nucleus. At these intermediate concentrations a heterogeneous heat shock response was observed. At lethal concentrations a strong heat shock response was observed with a widespread cellular response. This study demonstrates the potential of this immunocytochemistry technique to measure toxicological effects in cells by identifying the response quantitatively and qualitatively.,2020-05-01T17:14:30.887786,pubmed,3,41181326,,A Novel Immunocytochemistry Technique to Measure Hsp70 Induction in L929 Cells Exposed to Cadmium Chloride,353-63,4-5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1354-750X,biomarkers-biochemical-indicators-of-exposure-response-and-susceptibility-to-chemicals,Biomarkers,"Biomarkers : Biochemical Indicators of Exposure, Response, and Susceptibility to Chemicals",1588353270,9,1,E Gibney,2,J Gault,,1588353270,a-novel-immunocytochemistry-technique-to-measure-hsp70-induction-in-l929-cells-exposed-to-cadmium-chloride,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1080/13547500400018299,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15764298,2020-05-01T17:14:30.887786,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,evaluation-study,evaluation study,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,evaluation-study,evaluation study,J Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,61,0.615,,,,,,,,,,3,J Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R Allen,M Box,"Particulate matter (PM) is a ubiquitous air pollutant that has been receiving increasing attention in recent years due in part to the association between PM and a number of adverse health outcomes, including mortality and increases in emergency room visits and respiratory symptoms, as well as exacerbation of asthma and decrements in lung function. As a result, the ability to accurately sample ambient PM has become important, both to researchers and to regulatory agencies. The federal reference method for the determination of fine PM as PM2.5 in the atmosphere recommends that particle-sampling filters be conditioned and weighed in an environment with constant temperature and relative humidity (RH). It is also recommended that vibration, electrostatic charges, and contamination of the filters from laboratory air be minimized to reduce variability in filter weight measurements. These controls have typically been maintained in small, environmentally controlled ""cleanrooms.""

The advantages of IGC over other techniques, are (a) an efficient use of lab resources, (b) a high sensitivity to low partitioning coefficients and (c) a closer reproduction of field conditions. In our procedure, experiments with only two samples of different mass are necessary to establish if linear isotherms can be used to describe the retention of the contaminants. This approach gives information necessary for analyzing the feasibility and design of remediation technologies with a laboratory effort significantly smaller than the adsorption/desorption cycle for isotherm determination. The retention coefficients of the contaminants decrease as humidity increases in a similar fashion for all of them, probably because the reduction in the number of the adsorption sites available for the organic compounds due to the presence of water is quite similar for all the contaminants studied. These retention coefficients may be related to those obtained for dry air conditions for all the contaminants through (R - 1)RH% = A(R - 1)dry air(B), where the parameter B is found to remain approximately constant (0.90), while the parameter A decreases linearly with the relative moisture.",2020-05-01T05:49:24.710544,pubmed,5,36455387,970358400,Column Study of the Influence of Air Humidity on the Retention of Hydrocarbons on Soil,1167-72,8,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0045-6535,chemosphere,Chemosphere,Chemosphere,1588312164,41,1,F García-Herruzo,2,J M Rodríguez-Maroto,2000-10-01T00:00:00,1588312164,column-study-of-the-influence-of-air-humidity-on-the-retention-of-hydrocarbons-on-soil,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/s0045-6535(00)00012-6,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10901242,2020-05-01T05:49:24.710544,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,R A García-Delgado,C Gómez-Lahoz,C Vereda-Alonso,academic,Europe,ES,Spain,Universidad De Málaga,University of Málaga,,universidad-de-malaga,Universidad De Malaga,212,1.448,academic,Europe,ES,Spain,Universidad De Málaga,University of Málaga,,universidad-de-malaga,Universidad De Malaga,3,R A García-Delgado,4,C Gómez-Lahoz,TRUE,3902337,Carlos Villen-Guzman,carlos-villen-guzman,5,carlos-villen-guzman,C Vereda-Alonso,TRUE,1353822,Cesar Gomez-Lahoz,cesar-gomez-lahoz,,pii,,S0045-6535(00)00012-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,3902337,Carlos Villen-Guzman,carlos-villen-guzman,TRUE,1353822,Cesar Gomez-Lahoz,cesar-gomez-lahoz,cesar-gomez-lahoz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I Kaneva,A Mulchandani,"A unique approach for organophosphorus pesticides detoxification was developed previously by anchoring organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) onto the surface of Escherichia coli with a tightly regulated tac promoter. The resulting recombinant cells degraded parathion very effectively without the diffusional limitation observed in cells expressing OPH intracellularly. However, the precise conditions for surface targeting or pesticide degradation were not fully understood. In this paper, several factors influencing parathion degradation were investigated. Production of active OPH onto the cell surface was highly host-specific; a high rate of parathion degradation was observed from strains JM105 and XL1-Blue, which regulated production of the OPH fusion very tightly. However, in the absence of ampicillin selection, plasmids were only favorably maintained in strain XL1-Blue. OPH activity was highly dependent on growth conditions. Optimal OPH activity was observed when cells were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB)-buffered medium at 37 degrees C. OPH activity was further improved by supplementing the growth medium with cobalt chloride, which favors the formation of the metal active center. The timing of cobalt addition also influenced parathion degradation. Maximum OPH activity was obtained by adding cobalt to induced cultures during the late stationary phase. The resulting cultures grown under the optimized conditions had an eight-fold increase in parathion degradation.",2020-05-01T00:57:56.845219,pubmed,3,34353939,,Factors Influencing Parathion Degradation by Recombinant Escherichia Coli with Surface-Expressed Organophosphorus Hydrolase,275-8,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,8756-7938,biotechnology-progress,Biotechnol.

M Nakayama,K Takahashi,"Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), a rate-limiting enzyme in heme catabolism, has been reported to be induced by hypoxia. Unexpectedly, here we show that expression of HO-1 mRNA is repressed by hypoxia in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), but is increased by cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) that is known to mimic hypoxia. Under the culture conditions used, the DNA-binding and transactivation activities of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 were increased in HUVECs by hypoxia or CoCl(2). Therefore, hypoxia and cobalt showed opposing effects on HO-1 mRNA expression, despite activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1. The half-life of HO-1 mRNA was not changed by hypoxia, but was significantly prolonged by CoCl(2). Hypoxia also represses HO-1 mRNA expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells and astrocytes. The repression of HO-1 expression may represent the adaptation to hypoxia in certain cell types.",2020-05-01T06:14:17.152933,pubmed,8,36618726,958694400,Repression of Heme Oxygenase-1 by Hypoxia in Vascular Endothelial Cells,665-71,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0006-291X,biochemical-and-biophysical-research-communications,Biochem.

Barbara Griefahn,Christa Künemund,"The processes of acclimation to hot-dry and to warm-humid climates were studied using two approaches: a quantitative analysis of literature data and an experimental study in the laboratory concerning the physiological parameters of heart rate, rectal temperature, sweat loss, and subjective assessment. Analysis o f literature data: Data from 62 experiments with a total of 813 participants were pooled and recalculated. The experiments ranged from 6 to 24 days, air temperatures from 30.4 to 50.0°C, water vapor pressures from 1.5 to 6.5 kPa, and wet bulb globe temperatures (WBGT) from 27.4 to 38.6°C. Laboratory studies: In the laboratory, 8 participants were acclimated during 15 consecutive days to a hot-dry climate and to a warm-humid climate, which were equivalent in terms of the WBGT (33.5 and 33.6°C, respectively). The participants walked four times for 25 min on a treadmill at a speed of 4 km/h. The hot-dry climate caused somewhat greater strain than the warm-humid condition. In the course of acclimation to the hot-dry climate, heart rate and rectal temperature started at higher levels, decreased slightly steeper but remained on a higher level throughout. Nevertheless, the differences between both thermal conditions were small, and both physiologic functions reached the point of acclimation almost at the same time under warm-humid and under hot-dry exposure. Sweat loss, which is not regarded as a valid predictor for acclimation, was considerably higher but increased less in the hot-dry than in the warm-humid climate.",2020-05-01T06:10:32.915013,pubmed,4,36592457,820454400,Human Adaptation to Work in two Different Climates,60-73,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1080-3548,international-journal-of-occupational-safety-and-ergonomics-jose,Int J Occup Saf Ergon,International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics : Jose,1588313432,2,1,Barbara Griefahn,2,Christa Künemund,1996-01-01T00:00:00,1588313432,human-adaptation-to-work-in-two-different-climates,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1080/10803548.1996.11076338,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10602579,2020-05-01T06:10:32.915013,,,,,,,,,Hortense Neffgen,Stefan Sommer,,,,,,,,,,,28,0.516,,,,,,,,,,3,Hortense Neffgen,4,Stefan Sommer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,experimental study,acclimation,heat,literature study,physiologic variables,subjective assessment,experimental-study,experimental study,acclimation,acclimation,heat,heat,literature-study,literature study,physiologic-variables,physiologic variables,subjective-assessment,subjective assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C S Von Bartheld,M J Rickmann,"After application of various neuronal tracers (horseradish peroxidase, cobalt-chloride lysine, true blue) to the ganglion of the nervus terminalis a small number of neurons was retrogradely labeled in the mesencephalon. As revealed by combined horseradish peroxidase and catecholamine-fluorescence techniques these neurons are located in the isthmic area immediately rostral to, but not within the locus coeruleus. Cobalt-labeled axons of the mesencephalic neurons were traced individually in serial sections. Neurons projecting contralaterally cross in the horizontal commissure. Tracing of single fibers provided no evidence for axon collaterals within this pathway. Retrograde labeling reveals two different types of isthmic neurons afferent to the ganglion of the nervus terminalis: One smaller-sized type is located bilaterally and consists of four to six neurons; another type possessing many dendritic processes was consistently found as only one single cell located contralateral to the side of injection. The existence of two types of neurons was confirmed by their cytological differences: The small-sized type receives only sparse perisomatic input, while the large-sized type shows heavy somatic and dendritic, probably monoaminergic innervation.",2020-04-30T18:26:47.598209,pubmed,3,27728323,504921600,A Light- and Electron-Microscopic Study of Mesencephalic Neurons Projecting to the Ganglion of the Nervus Terminalis in the Goldfish,63-70,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0302-766X,cell-and-tissue-research,Cell Tissue Res.,Cell and Tissue Research,1588271207,246,1,C S Von Bartheld,2,M J Rickmann,1986-01-01T00:00:00,1588271207,a-light-and-electron-microscopic-study-of-mesencephalic-neurons-projecting-to-the-ganglion-of-the-nervus-terminalis-in-the-goldfish,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2430717,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/bf00219000,2020-04-30T18:26:47.598209,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,D L Meyer,,,,,,,,,,,,125,1.418,,,,,,,,,,3,D L Meyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J H Foreman,T L Grubb,"This study was designed to characterise the acid-base and electrolyte effects of shortening the distance required during steeplechase (Phase B) in the face of hot and humid weather conditions during a treadmill-simulated Speed and Endurance test. Eight conditioned Thoroughbred horses underwent 3 randomised permutations of a standardised exercise test on a high speed treadmill. Each test consisted of trotting at 3.7 m/s for 10 min (Phase A); galloping at 11 m/s (Phase B) for 4 (cool laboratory conditions), 3 (hot and humid), or 2 (hot and humid) min; trotting at 3.7 m/s for 30 min (Phase C); and walking at 1.8 m/s for 10 min (Phase X). The treadmill slope was 4% for trotting and galloping and 0% for walking. Cool versus hot and humid conditions were 20 degrees C and 50-60% relative humidity vs. 26-28 degrees C and 80-85% relative humidity, respectively. Pulmonary artery blood samples were obtained at rest prior to exercise (Rest); at the end of Phases A (A10) and B (B2-4); at 10 (C10), 20 (C20) and 30 (C30) min through Phase C; and at 5 min into Phase X (X5). Additional samples for lactate (LA) and glucose (GLC) analysis were obtained 5 min into Phase C (C5) and at the end of Phase X (X10). Samples were analysed for packed cell volume (PCV), haemoglobin (HB), total plasma protein (TP), sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), anion gap (AG), plasma glucose (GLC) and lactate (LA), pH, PCO2, bicarbonate (HCO3) and base excess (BE). Shortening steeplechase distance by 50% under hot and humid conditions (2 min B) resulted in a consistent return to control measurements (4 min B) only for plasma LA. Changes in PCV, HB, TP, K and Cl were related more to the longer galloping distance in the 4 min B trials than to hot vs. cold laboratory conditions. Alternatively, changes in LA, GLC, pH, PCO2 and AG were more related to hot and humid laboratory conditions than they were to galloping distance. These latter variables, when combined with physical measures such as core temperature, bodyweight loss, point of fatigue on Phase C and recovery heart rates may serve as the best monitors of positive responses in future studies of proposed modifications to Phase C, rather than those variables which were more distance than weather-related.",2020-05-01T00:28:21.260088,pubmed,6,34140954,836179200,Acid-Base and Electrolyte Effects of Shortening Steeplechase in a Three-Day-Event,85-90,22,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,equine-veterinary-journal-supplement,Equine Vet J Suppl,Equine Veterinary Journal.

P Sandner,B Gess,"There is accumulating evidence from in vitro experiments that the gene expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is, like that of the erythropoietin (EPO) gene, regulated by the oxygen tension and by divalent cations such as cobalt.

To this end male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to carbon monoxide (0.1% CO), hypoxia (8% O2 ) or to cobalt chloride (12 and 60 mg/kg s.c.) for 6 h. mRNA levels for VEGF- 188, -164, and -120 amino acid isoforms in lungs, hearts, kidneys and livers were semiquantitated by RNase protection. For these organs we found a rank order of VEGF mRNA abundance of lung >> heart > kidney = liver. EPO mRNA levels were semiquantitated in kidneys and livers. Hypoxia, CO and cobalt increased EPO mRNA levels 60-fold, 140-fold and 5-fold, respectively, in the kidneys, and 11-fold, 11-fold and 3-fold, respectively, in the livers. None of these manoeuvres caused significant changes of VEGF mRNA in lung, heart or kidneys. Only in the livers did hypoxia lead to a significant (50%) increase of VEGF mRNA. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the in vitro situation, the expression of the VEGF gene in normal rat tissues is rather insensitive to hypoxia. In consequence, the in vivo regulation of the VEGF and the EPO genes appear to differ substantially, suggesting that the regulation of the VEGF and EPO genes may not follow the same essential mechanisms in vivo.",2020-05-01T00:42:11.580754,pubmed,4,34242437,828316800,Divergent Regulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and of Erythropoietin Gene Expression in Vivo,905-12,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0031-6768,pflugers-archiv-european-journal-of-physiology,Pflugers Arch.,Pflugers Archiv : European Journal of Physiology,1588293731,431,1,P Sandner,2,B Gess,1996-04-01T00:00:00,1588293731,divergent-regulation-of-vascular-endothelial-growth-factor-and-of-erythropoietin-gene-expression-in-vivo,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8927508,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/s004240050084,2020-05-01T00:42:11.580754,,,,,,,,,K Wolf,A Kurtz,,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,Universität Regensburg,University of Regensburg,,universitat-regensburg,Universitat Regensburg,120,1.548,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,Universität Regensburg,University of Regensburg,,universitat-regensburg,Universitat Regensburg,3,K Wolf,4,A Kurtz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gina M Yanochko,Su Khoh-Reiter,"Preservatives are used in ocular medications to prevent microbial contamination. The use of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), the most widely used preservative in ocular medications, has been scrutinized with a number of studies indicating its toxicity to monolayer cultures of corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the toxicity of BAC and other preservatives and common components of ocular formulations on monolayer and stratified air-lifted cultures of Chang conjunctival cells. Air-lifting Chang cells grown on transwell filters increased stratification as assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance and histology. Unlike monolayer cultures in which ocular medications containing BAC caused near complete loss of cell viability, stratified, air-lifted cultures were not affected by the presence of BAC in ocular medications with up to 30-min exposures. Stratification shifted the dose-response curve to the right for benzalkonium chloride, thimerosal, chlorhexidine digluconate, potassium sorbate and EDTA. These results demonstrate that stratification significantly affects cell viability of Chang conjunctival cells in response to preservatives and additives of ophthalmic preparations.",2020-05-02T02:44:55.099164,pubmed,4,45139239,1275350400,Comparison of Preservative-Induced Toxicity on Monolayer and Stratified Chang Conjunctival Cells,1324-31,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0887-2333,toxicology-in-vitro-an-international-journal-published-in-association-with-bibra,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in Vitro : an International Journal Published in Association with Bibra,1588387495,24,1,Gina M Yanochko,2,Su Khoh-Reiter,2010-06-01T00:00:00,1588387495,comparison-of-preservative-induced-toxicity-on-monolayer-and-stratified-chang-conjunctival-cells,journal-article,journal article,,pii,,S0887-2333(10)00015-9,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/j.tiv.2010.02.001,2020-05-02T02:44:55.099164,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,Mark G Evans,Bart A Jessen,,,,,,,,,,,96,0.895,,,,,,,,,,3,Mark G Evans,4,Bart A Jessen,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20144907,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fernando H F Alves,Carlos C Crestani,"Acute restraint is an unavoidable stress situation that evokes marked and sustained cardiovascular changes, which are characterized by blood pressure and heart rate increases. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that insular cortex mediates cardiovascular responses to acute restraint stress in rats. To that purpose, the insular cortex synaptic transmission was inhibited by bilateral microinjection of the nonselective synaptic blocker cobalt chloride (CoCl2, 1 mM/100 nL). Insular cortex pretreatment with CoCl2 decreased restraint-evoked pressor and tachycardiac responses, thus indicating an involvement of synapses within the insular cortex on the modulation of cardiovascular responses to restraint stress. The present results indicate that insular cortex synapses exert a facilitatory influence on blood pressure and HR increase evoked by acute restraint stress in rats.",2020-05-02T01:59:31.247274,pubmed,3,44709626,1275004800,The Insular Cortex Modulates Cardiovascular Responses to Acute Restraint Stress in Rats,57-63,,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0006-8993,brain-research,Brain Res.,Brain Research,1588384771,1333,1,Fernando H F Alves,2,Carlos C Crestani,2010-05-28T00:00:00,1588384771,the-insular-cortex-modulates-cardiovascular-responses-to-acute-restraint-stress-in-rats,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/j.brainres.2010.03.077,,pii,,S0006-8993(10)00714-6,2020-05-02T01:59:31.247274,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Fernando M A Corrêa,,,,,,,,,,,,188,1.364,,,,,,,,,,3,Fernando M A Corrêa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20353759,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Khalid Belghazi,Elmountacer Billah Elabbassi,"In human adults, experimental assessment of the evaporative heat loss coefficient (h(e)) requires a fully wetted skin surface area implying exposure to severe heat stress. For ethical reasons, this type of experimental situation is impossible to perform on neonates. The aim of the present study was to assess h(e) values in clinical situations for the body as a whole and for the different body segments, in particular, in natural and forced convection and using an anthropomorphic, sweating, thermal mannequin to represent a very small premature neonate (body mass 900 g). Skin hydration (i.e., simulated sweating) was performed by two electronic pumping systems, providing a steady adjustable flow of water to the mannequin surface. Experiments were carried out in a closed-incubator heated to air temperatures of 33 degrees C and 36 degrees C, with air velocities (Va) ranging from 0.01 to 0.7 m s(-1), and with four levels of air relative humidity (40, 50, 60, and 80%). For the body as a whole, h(e)=7 W m(-2) mb(-1) in natural convection, whereas in forced convection h(e) was 11.7, 12.4, and 14.1 W m(-2) mb(-1) for air velocities of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.7 m s(-1), respectively. As far as local h(e) is concerned, our results showed that the relative values of regional water loss in forced convection differ greatly from those observed under still air conditions. Thus, increasing air velocity enhances the heterogeneity in regional skin cooling, which may contribute to the neonate's thermal discomfort.",2020-05-01T17:22:32.201868,pubmed,4,41403046,1109635200,Assessment of whole Body and Regional Evaporative Heat Loss Coefficients in very Premature Infants using a Thermal Mannequin: Influence of Air Velocity,752-8,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0094-2405,medical-physics,Med Phys,Medical Physics,1588353752,32,1,Khalid Belghazi,2,Elmountacer Billah Elabbassi,2005-03-01T00:00:00,1588353752,assessment-of-whole-body-and-regional-evaporative-heat-loss-coefficients-in-very-premature-infants-using-a-thermal-mannequin-influence-of-air-velocity,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1118/1.1862074,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15839347,2020-05-01T17:22:32.201868,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,evaluation-study,evaluation study,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,evaluation-study,evaluation study,Pierre Tourneux,Jean-Pierre Libert,,academic,Europe,FR,France,Université De Picardie Jules Verne,Amiens University,Universite D'Amiens,universite-de-picardie-jules-verne,Universite De Picardie Jules Verne,159,1.274,academic,Europe,FR,France,Université De Picardie Jules Verne,Amiens University,Universite D'Amiens,universite-de-picardie-jules-verne,Universite De Picardie Jules Verne,3,Pierre Tourneux,4,Jean-Pierre Libert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Upjv,Upjv,,,,,,,,University of Picardy Jules Verne,University of Picardy Jules Verne,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,validation-study,validation study,validation-study,validation study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A S Teirstein,,"The clinical hallmarks of asthma are wheezing and reversibility. Any disease that impairs air flow through obstructed airways may cause wheezing. Patients with true asthma may give a history of allergy and past attacks of dyspnea and wheezing occurring when exposed to allergens, inhaled irritants, upper respiratory infection, cold and humid air, exercise, and emotional stress. When encountering a wheezing dyspneic patient who does not report such a history, it behooves the physician to entertain the possibility that the patient may have a disease other than asthma. Chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, cardiogenic pulmonary edema pulmonary emboli, aspiration of gastric contents, and upper airway obstruction are the common causes of nonasthmatic wheezing. In almost every instance a wide spectrum of easily obtainable data, particularly historical, are available to alert the physician that the patient's dyspnea and wheezing are not due to asthma.

B Lighthart,,"Vegetative cells of Serratia marcescens 8UK, Sarcina lutea, and spores of Bacillus subtilus var. niger were held in aerosols, with and without an urban concentration of CO (85 muliters per liter or ppm), for up to 6 hr at 15 C and a relative humidity (RH) of approximately 0, 25, 50, 75, and 95%. It was found that CO enhanced the death rate of S. marcescens 8UK at least four- to sevenfold at low RH (ca. 1 to 25%), but protected the cells at high RH (ca. 90%). Death rates of S. lutea, with or without added CO, were comparatively low over the entire RH range. However, in the first hour, airborne S. lutea held in CO-containing air were more stable than those in air without added CO (i.e., CO protection). A marked increase in the death rate (up to 70-fold) occurred in the subsequent 5 hr within the RH range of approximately 0 to 75%. Statistical analysis indicated that aerosol decay rates of B. subtilus var. niger spores decreased significantly, when held in a CO-containing as compared to a non-CO-containing atmosphere, in the 0 to 85% RH range. Thus, the data presented indicate that CO in the urban environment may have a protective or lethal effect on airborne bacteria, dependent upon at least the microbial species, aerosol age, and relative humidity. A mechanism for CO death enhancement and protection of airborne S. marcescens 8UK is suggested to involve CO uncoupling of an energy-requiring death mechanism and an energy-requiring maintenance mechanism at high and low RH, respectively.",2020-04-30T19:35:29.044919,pubmed,1,29786552,94694400,Survival of Airborne Bacteria in a High Urban Concentration of Carbon Monoxide,86-91,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,applied-microbiology,Appl Microbiol,Applied Microbiology,1588275329,25,1,B Lighthart,,,1973-01-01T00:00:00,1588275329,survival-of-airborne-bacteria-in-a-high-urban-concentration-of-carbon-monoxide,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC380740,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,4631439,2020-04-30T19:35:29.044919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keith J Winstanley,Andrew M Sayer,"The X-ray structure of the ClC chloride channel made it clear that O-H...chloride interactions play a key role in important biological membrane-bound systems, however, surprisingly this type of interaction has only been rarely exploited for the development of synthetic anion receptors. This paper therefore reports the anion binding strengths and selectivities of some simple commercially available bis-phenols. In particular, we compare catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene) and resorcinol (1,3-dihydroxybenzene) which show interesting and different selectivities between the halide anions in acetonitrile solution. Catechol binds tetrabutylammononium (TBA) chloride almost 30 times more strongly than TBA bromide, whilst for resorcinol, this difference drops to a factor of ca. 3.5. It is suggested that this is a consequence of the bite angle of the chelating hydrogen bonding groups of catechol being particularly appropriate for effective binding of the smaller anion. The oxidation of catechol to ortho-quinone is perturbed by the addition of chloride anions, as probed via cyclic voltammetry, and this compound can therefore be considered to act as an electrochemical sensor for chloride. Nitrocatechol is able to bind chloride anions more strongly than catechol as a consequence of its enhanced acidity and hence greater hydrogen bond donor character. Furthermore, nitrocatechol senses the bound anion via changes in its UV-visible spectrum. Notably, binding still occurs even in the presence of small amounts of competitive solvents (e.g. water). This observation has biomimetic importance as wet acetonitrile has some similarity in terms of overall polarity and hydrogen bond competition to the solvent shielded interiors of biological macromolecules and membranes--such as the environment within the ClC chloride channel itself. Finally, we report that catechol undergoes a unique colorimetric response on the addition of basic anions, such as fluoride. We can assign this response as being due to oxidative degradation of catechol catalysed by the basic anions (which bind to, and deprotonate, the catechol). This process is somewhat analogous to the well-known metal catalysed oxidation of catechol which can take place in aqueous solution. The speed of response and easily monitored and distinctive colour change induced by fluoride anions indicates this may be a useful mechanism for exploitation in the development of selective fluoride sensors.",2020-05-01T17:21:21.247821,pubmed,3,41369691,1146960000,"Anion Binding by Catechols--An Nmr, Optical and Electrochemical Study",1760-7,9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1477-0520,organic-biomolecular-chemistry,Org.

Kango Fujitani,Hiroshi Manami,"Adipic acid and glutaric acid were obtained from 1-hydroxy-2- acetoxycyclohexane by oxidation cleavage using molecular oxygen in the presence of cobalt acetate, manganese acetate and hydrobromic acid in acetic acid solution. Applying this method to prepare dicarboxylic acids from unsaturated fatty acids, we proposed an efficient method where reaction mixture of unsaturated fatty acids and hydrogen peroxide - formic acid can be oxidative cleaved to produce dicarboxylic acids and monocarboxylic acids in acetic acid solution with molecular oxygen / Co-Mn-Br system. For example, azelaic acid, suberic acid and other dicarboxylic acid as dicarboxylic acids were obtained from industrial oleic acid, which contained oleic acid, palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid. As a result of investigation for reaction condition, increase of partial pressure of molecular oxygen or elevation of temperature accelerated oxidative cleavage, but total yields of azelaic acid and suberic acid were slightly decreased. Besides, effect of hydrohalic acids in liquid phase air oxidation in the presence of cobalt and manganese acetates was investigated to show that HBr was the most effective. Soybean acid and tall acid containing higher amounts of linoleic acid and linolenic acid than industrial oleic acid were also oxidatively cleaved to dicarboxylic acids.",2020-05-02T02:06:52.614292,pubmed,5,44773788,1230768000,Preparation of Polycarboxylic Acids by Oxidative Cleavage with Oxygen / Co-Mn-Br System,629-37,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1345-8957,journal-of-oleo-science,J Oleo Sci,Journal of Oleo Science,1588385212,58,1,Kango Fujitani,2,Hiroshi Manami,2009-01-01T00:00:00,1588385212,preparation-of-polycarboxylic-acids-by-oxidative-cleavage-with-oxygen-co-mn-br-system,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19915320,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.5650/jos.58.629,2020-05-02T02:06:52.614292,,,,,,,,,Mikio Nakazawa,Tatsuo Oida,Tokuzo Kawase,,,,,,,,,,37,0.392,,,,,,,,,,3,Mikio Nakazawa,4,Tatsuo Oida,,,,,5,,Tokuzo Kawase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H Marty,,"In the region of the small town of Biel, cases of various acute respiratory illnesses among children were recorded and correlated with measured parameters of meteorology and air pollution (sulfur dioxide, dust) during a period of one and a half years.

S R Muza,A J Young,"The effects of cold acclimation (CA) on the cardiorespiratory responses to cold air and water stress tests (CST) were studied in 7 males before and after a CA program of daily 90-min cold water (18 degrees C) immersions repeated 5 times a wk for 5 consecutive wk. The CST consisted of a 90-min resting exposure to cold air (5 degrees C, 30% relative humidity) or water (18 degrees C) during which rectal temperature, oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2), minute ventilation (VE), heart rate, cardiac output (Q), and blood pressure (BP) were periodically measured. In cold air following CA, the VO2 at 10 min was lower (P less than 0.02) post- than pre-CA, however, no differences were found in cold water. The VE increased (P less than 0.01) during CST as a function of VCO2. The CA did not affect the VE-VCO2 relationship or the pattern of breathing during CST in cold air or water. The CA had no effect on Q or (a-v) O2 difference, which both increased (P less than 0.01) during the first 45 min of CST, then remained stable. BP increased significantly during the first cold water exposure, but not during the last cold water immersion. These data indicate that CA attenuated the onset of metabolic heat production during CST in air but did not alter its ultimate magnitude or the relationships between the cardiorespiratory variables and metabolic requirements. Also, the thermoregulatory adjustments associated with CA altered the control of blood pressure during acute cold stress.",2020-04-30T18:39:16.732196,pubmed,5,28091916,578448000,Respiratory and Cardiovascular Responses to Cold Stress Following Repeated Cold Water Immersion,165-78,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,undersea-biomedical-research,Undersea Biomed Res,Undersea Biomedical Research,1588271956,15,1,S R Muza,2,A J Young,1988-05-01T00:00:00,1588271956,respiratory-and-cardiovascular-responses-to-cold-stress-following-repeated-cold-water-immersion,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,3388627,,,,,2020-04-30T18:39:16.732196,,,,,,,,,M N Sawka,J E Bogart,K B Pandolf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,M N Sawka,4,J E Bogart,,,,,5,,K B Pandolf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
J F Heidelberg,M Shahamat,"Estimations of the bacterial content of air can be more easily made now than a decade ago, with colony formation the method of choice for enumeration of airborne bacteria. However, plate counts are subject to error because bacteria exposed to the air may remain viable yet lose the ability to form colonies, i.e., they become viable but nonculturable. If airborne bacteria exhibit this phenomenon, colony formation data will significantly underestimate the bacterial populations in air samples. The objective of the study reported here was to determine the effect of aerosolization on viability and colony-forming ability of Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella planticola, and Cytophaga allerginae. A collision nebulizer was used to spray bacterial suspensions into an aerosol chamber, after which duplicate samples were collected in all-glass impingers over a 4-h period. Humidity was maintained at ca. 20 to 25%, and temperature was maintained at 20 to 22 degrees C for each of two replicate trials per microorganism. Viability was determined by using a modified direct viable count method, employing nalidixic acid or aztreonam and p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (INT). Cells were stained with acridine orange and observed by epifluorescence microscopy to enumerate total and viable cells. Viable cells were defined as those elongating in the presence of antibiotic and/or reducing INT. CFU were determined by plating on tryptic soy agar and R2A agar. It was found that culture techniques did not provide an adequate description of the bacterial burdens of indoor air (i.e., less than 10% of the aerosolized bacteria were capable of forming visible colonies). It is concluded that total cell count procedures provide a better approximation of the number of bacterial cells in air and that procedures other than plate counting are needed to enumerate bacteria in aerosol samples, especially if the public health quality of indoor air is to be estimated.",2020-05-01T00:21:41.480358,pubmed,7,34091695,873072000,Effect of Aerosolization on Culturability and Viability of Gram-Negative Bacteria,3585-8,9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0099-2240,applied-and-environmental-microbiology,Appl.

Data on these variables were obtained through a survey in which 325 families completed questionnaires; 121 families had asthmatic children who were 2-20 years of age. Pearson correlational analyses revealed many significant positive correlations: The frequencies of prior and recent infections were correlated. The frequency of prior infections was correlated with the impacts of all asthma triggers except allergy problems, but the frequency of recent infections was correlated only with the impacts of air pollution, cigarette smoke, respiratory infection, and nighttime hours as triggers of asthma attacks.

A Watkinson,C Harding,"Exposure to a dry environment leads to depletion of water from the peripheral stratum corneum layers in a process dependent on the relative humidity (RH) and the intrinsic properties of the tissue. We hypothesized that by modulating the water content of the stratum corneum in the surface layers, RH effects the rate of desquamation by modulating the activity of the desquamatory enzymes, and specifically stratum corneum chymotryptic enzyme (SCCE). Using a novel air interface in vitro desquamatory model, we demonstrated RH-dependent corneocyte release with desquamatory rates decreasing below 80% RH. Application of 10% glycerol or a glycerol-containing moisturizing lotion further increased desquamation, even in humid conditions, demonstrating that water was the rate-limiting factor in the final stages of desquamation. Furthermore, even in humid conditions desquamation was sub-maximal. In situ stratum corneum SCCE activity showed a dependence on RH: activity was significantly higher at 100% than at 44% RH. Further increases in SCCE activity were induced by applying a 10% glycerol solution. Since SCCE, a water-requiring enzyme, must function in the water-depleted outer stratum corneum, we sought to determine whether this enzyme has a tolerance to lowered water activity. Using concentrated sucrose solutions to lower water activity, we analysed the activity of recombinant SCCE and compared it to that of trypsin and chymotrypsin. SCCE activity demonstrated a tolerance to water restriction, and this may be an adaptation to maintain enzyme activity even within the water-depleted stratum corneum intercellular space. Overall these findings support the concept that in the upper stratum corneum, RH modulates desquamation by its effect upon SCCE activity, and possibly other desquamatory hydrolases. In addition, SCCE may be adapted to function in the water-restricted stratum corneum intercellular space.",2020-05-01T06:19:16.387828,pubmed,4,36651874,999302400,Water Modulation of Stratum Corneum Chymotryptic Enzyme Activity and Desquamation,470-6,9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0340-3696,archives-of-dermatological-research,Arch.

K Kurihara,Y Miyamoto,"TOM-III may be useful for microclimate evaluation and/or the development of clothing without considering individual variation against various climatic conditions. Approximately 5 min after the onset of sweating, the IRH of the CWU-66/P (38.0%) was lower than JASDF flight coverall (42.1%; p < 0.01). At the end of the sweating period, the IRH of the CWU-66/P and the JASDF flight coverall were 46.2% and 52.6%, respectively (p < 0.01). The results indicated that the CWU-66/P flight coverall was better suited for heat stress than the JASDF summer-type flight coverall. TOM-III (TOYOBO, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) has a characteristic Japanese human body type, and the sweat rate and body temperature can be regulated (240 g of sweat per hour, 36.0 degrees C). The microclimate of the clothing was evaluated by means of 20 temperature/humidity sensors located on the surface of the mannequin skin. TOM-III wore four different assemblies of clothing (CWU-66/P USAF chemical defense flight coverall; JASDF summer-type flight coverall which is similar to the nonchemical defense USAF flight coverall; ordinary 100% cotton underwear; and CWU-66/ P with cotton underwear). We put TOM-III in climatic chamber (21.2 +/- 0.5 degrees C, 50.0 +/- 3.0% relative humidity (RH), 0.1 m air flow x s(-1), dressed in test clothing, and measured the inside temperature (IT) and inside relative humidity (IRH) of the clothing for 60 min (10 min non-sweating, 30 min sweating and 20 min non-sweating). The present study used a Japanese type sweating mannequin (TOM-III) to evaluate the microclimate of flight coveralls. It is important to examine the microclimate of a pilot's clothing to evaluate the heat stress the clothing imparts on a pilot, but problems arise with regard to individual variation (phenotype of the pilot, sweating dose, wear condition of the flight coveralls, etc.).",2020-05-01T02:26:55.032578,pubmed,2,34986957,912470400,Flight Coverall Microclimate Evaluation using a Japanese Type Sweating Mannequin,1174-7,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0095-6562,aviation-space-and-environmental-medicine,Aviat Space Environ Med,"Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine",1588300015,69,1,K Kurihara,2,Y Miyamoto,1998-12-01T00:00:00,1588300015,flight-coverall-microclimate-evaluation-using-a-japanese-type-sweating-mannequin,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9856542,,,,,2020-05-01T02:26:55.032578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bobby E Leonard,,"Unattached fraction (218)Po airborne particle size distributions from graded screen array diffusion batteries are analysed for bimodal constituents. The analysis is for the high (222)Rn concentration range from 10 to 50 kBq m(-3) where the recently reported enhanced deposition effect is in transition. We find that the single unattached fraction is distributed nominally at an arithmetic mean diameter (AMD) of 0.8-1.0 nm, and consists of two (218)Po molecular species with AMD congruent with 0.756 and 1.101 nm, respectively. In unfiltered room air the 0.756 nm species is the least stable, decreases monotonically in concentration magnitude beginning at 12 kBq m(-3) and disappears completely at approximately 32 kBq m(-3) (at a relative humidity of 54%). The AMD congruent with 1.101 nm mode does not become unstable until it reaches approximately 32 kBq m(-3) (222)Rn level and completely disappears at approximately 50 kBq m(-3).

Richard Ortega,Carole Bresson,"Cobalt is known to be toxic at high concentration, to induce contact dermatosis, and occupational radiation skin damage because of its use in nuclear industry. We investigated the intracellular distribution of cobalt in HaCaT human keratinocytes as a model of skin cells, and its interaction with endogenous trace elements. Direct micro-chemical imaging based on ion beam techniques was applied to determine the quantitative distribution of cobalt in HaCaT cells. In addition, synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence microanalysis in tomography mode was performed, for the first time on a single cell, to determine the 3D intracellular distribution of cobalt. Results obtained with these micro-chemical techniques were compared to a more classical method based on cellular fractionation followed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) measurements. Cobalt was found to accumulate in the cell nucleus and in perinuclear structures indicating the possible direct interaction with genomic DNA, and nuclear proteins. The perinuclear accumulation in the cytosol suggests that cobalt could be stored in the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus. The multi-elemental analysis revealed that cobalt exposure significantly decreased magnesium and zinc content, with a likely competition of cobalt for magnesium and zinc binding sites in proteins. Overall, these data suggest a multiform toxicity of cobalt related to interactions with genomic DNA and nuclear proteins, and to the alteration of zinc and magnesium homeostasis.",2020-05-02T01:57:57.113941,pubmed,12,44695574,1247184000,Cobalt Distribution in Keratinocyte Cells Indicates Nuclear and Perinuclear Accumulation and Interaction with Magnesium and Zinc Homeostasis,26-32,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0378-4274,toxicology-letters,Toxicol.

Susan F Te Pas,Jan J Koenderink,"Human observers seem to be able to use different features that classify materials with a large degree of accuracy. In this paper, we look at human perception of statistical properties of the spectral distribution in a scene. We investigated whether human observers can discriminate just as accurately between coloured textures that have a spectral distribution due either to shading only or to both shading and specular reflectance as between uniform colours. Thresholds for the discrimination of coloured textures are about 15 times as high as thresholds for the discrimination of uniform colours, provided there is a sharp transition between the two colours. However, the coloured texture thresholds are only 1.5 times higher when we introduce a gradual transition between the two colours. There are also distinct qualitative differences in discrimination thresholds for different base colours. These differences cannot be predicted from discrimination thresholds for uniform colours. Human observers are surprisingly good at discriminating between a material edge and a shadow edge in complex scenes. Statistical differences in the orientation of the colour distributions in colour space might be used to accomplish this. In a second experiment we investigated how well observers can discriminate between two linear distributions in colour space that have the same base colour but different orientations. When we vary the line-length in R, G, B space, thresholds cannot be predicted completely by the conservation of the average distance between the two distributions. This means that observers use not only the maximum colour difference in the stimulus to do the task, but other cues are also involved.",2020-05-01T17:10:20.340001,pubmed,2,41071457,1072915200,Visual Discrimination of Spectral Distributions,1483-97,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0301-0066,perception,Perception,Perception,1588353020,33,1,Susan F Te Pas,2,Jan J Koenderink,2004-01-01T00:00:00,1588353020,visual-discrimination-of-spectral-distributions,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15729915,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1068/p5324,2020-05-01T17:10:20.340001,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,Utrecht University,Ruu,Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht,universiteit-utrecht,Universiteit Utrecht,81,0.764,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,Utrecht University,Ruu,Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht,universiteit-utrecht,Universiteit Utrecht,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Academic Biomedical Centre Utrecht,Academic Biomedical Centre Utrecht,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
B Claes,R Dekeyser,"Protein changes induced by salinity stress were investigated in the roots of the salt-sensitive rice cultivar Taichung native 1. We found eight proteins to be induced and obtained partial sequences of one with a molecular mass of 15 kilodaltons and an isoelectric point of 5.5. Using an oligonucleotide probe based on this information, a cDNA clone, salT, was selected and found to contain an open reading frame coding for a protein of 145 amino acid residues. salT mRNA accumulates very rapidly in sheaths and roots from mature plants and seedlings upon treatment with Murashige and Skoog salts (1%), air drying, abscisic acid (20 microM), polyethylene glycol (5%), sodium chloride (1%), and potassium chloride (1%). Generally, no induction was seen in the leaf lamina even when the stress should affect all parts of the plant uniformly. The organ-specific response of salT is correlatable with the pattern of Na+ accumulation during salt stress.",2020-04-30T18:31:07.929193,pubmed,7,27854208,631152000,Characterization of a Rice Gene Showing Organ-Specific Expression in Response to Salt Stress and Drought,19-27,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1040-4651,the-plant-cell,Plant Cell,The Plant Cell,1588271467,2,1,B Claes,2,R Dekeyser,1990-01-01T00:00:00,1588271467,characterization-of-a-rice-gene-showing-organ-specific-expression-in-response-to-salt-stress-and-drought,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1105/tpc.2.1.19,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2152105,2020-04-30T18:31:07.929193,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,R Villarroel,M Van Den Bulcke,G Bauw,,,,,,,,,,309,5.624,,,,,,,,,,3,R Villarroel,4,M Van Den Bulcke,,,,,5,,G Bauw,,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC159860,,,,,,,,M Van Montagu,A Caplan,,,6,M Van Montagu,7,A Caplan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J Korf,L Veenma-Van Der Duin,"These results warrant further exploration of cobalt as a PET or SPECT label of human lymphocytes. At high concentrations (more than 100 x necessary for adequate labeling), cobalt was not cytotoxic. Incubation of labeled lymphocytes in tissue culture medium for 24 hr in vitro showed a loss of less than half of the incorporated cobalt radioactivity. Twenty-four hours after in vitro labeling of lymphocytes and intravenous injection, radioactivity accumulated not only in the liver, kidney and bladder of the rat but in the spleen and lungs, which differed from the distribution of the free tracer. Uptake and binding to rat lymphocytes of Co2+ partly mimicked that of Ca2+. The binding of cobalt, however, was stronger and nonsaturable. Isolated rat lymphocytes were incubated with 57CoCl2 with or without unlabeled CoCl2 or CaCl2 carrier or other compounds. In some experiments, the accumulation of radioactive cobalt and calcium in lymphocytes was determined in the presence of phorbol myristate acetate alone, calcimycine alone or in combination. The toxicity of cobalt to lymphocytes was assessed with the trypan blue exclusion test and by assessing their proliferative capacity using radioactive thymidine incorporation as a readout. Biodistribution of cobalt-labeled lymphocytes was determined with postmortem analysis and compared with that of the free (nonlymphocyte-bound) tracer. PET and SPECT allow the study of the distribution of lymphocytes in living humans, provided that these cells are adequately prelabeled ex vivo. Such a labeling technique should not only be nontoxic to lymphocytes but it also should take into consideration that their kinetics are such that radioactivity must be followed for at least 24 hr. We describe the potential of divalent cobalt isotopes (55Co2+, half-life 17.5 hr for PET; 57Co2+, half-life 270 days for SPECT) for labeling lymphocytes.",2020-05-01T02:14:20.614206,pubmed,5,34897652,893980800,Divalent Cobalt as a Label to Study Lymphocyte Distribution using Pet and Spect,836-41,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0161-5505,journal-of-nuclear-medicine-official-publication-society-of-nuclear-medicine,J.

Kaspar Delhey,Claudia Burger,"Changes of plumage coloration independent of moult are probably widespread; they should be perceivable by birds and have the potential to affect colour signalling. We studied changes in coloration after moult in four passerine birds (robin, Erithacus rubecula; blackbird, Turdus merula; blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus; and great tit, Parus major) displaying various coloration types (melanin-, carotenoid-based and structural). Birds were caught regularly during three years to measure plumage reflectance. We used models of avian colour vision to derive two variables, one describing chromatic and the other achromatic variation over the year that can be compared in magnitude among different colour types. All studied plumage patches but one (yellow breast of the blue tit) showed significant chromatic changes over the year, although these were smaller than for a typical dynamic trait (bill colour). Overall, structural colours showed a reduction in relative reflectance at shorter wavelengths, carotenoid-based colours the opposite pattern, while no general pattern was found for melanin-based colours. Achromatic changes were also common, but there were no consistent patterns of change for the different types of colours. Plumage coloration is important for bird communication, most notably in sexual signalling. Colour is often considered a good quality indicator, and the expression of exaggerated colours may depend on individual condition during moult. After moult, plumage coloration has been deemed fixed due to the fact that feathers are dead structures. Still, many plumage colours change after moult, although whether this affects signalling has not been sufficiently assessed.",2020-05-02T02:31:17.487709,pubmed,4,44995962,1279065600,"Seasonal Changes in Colour: a Comparison of Structural, Melanin- and Carotenoid-Based Plumage Colours",e11582,7,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1932-6203,plos-one,PLoS ONE,Plos one,1588386677,5,1,Kaspar Delhey,2,Claudia Burger,2010-07-14T00:00:00,1588386677,seasonal-changes-in-colour-a-comparison-of-structural-melanin-and-carotenoid-based-plumage-colours,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20644723,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1371/journal.pone.0011582,2020-05-02T02:31:17.487709,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Wolfgang Fiedler,Anne Peters,,,,,,,,,,,268,1.1,,,,,,,,,,3,Wolfgang Fiedler,4,Anne Peters,,,,,,,,TRUE,1580592,Wolfgang Fiedler,wolfgang-fiedler-07f961c4f68d4f5c8abd3f2064debc2d,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC2904367,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,1580592,Wolfgang Fiedler,wolfgang-fiedler-07f961c4f68d4f5c8abd3f2064debc2d,wolfgang-fiedler-07f961c4f68d4f5c8abd3f2064debc2d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N Aharoni,A Blumenfeld,"The interrelationship between water deficiency and hormonal makeup in plants was investigated in detached leaves of romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. ;Hazera Yellow'). Water stress was imposed by desiccating the leaves for several hours in light or darkness at different air temperatures and relative humidity. In the course of desiccation, a rise in abscisic acid content and a decline in gibberellin and cytokinin activity were observed by gas-liquid chromatography, by both the barley endosperm bioassay and radioimmunoassay and by the soybean callus bioassay. Gibberellin activity began to decline in the stressed leaves before the rise in abscisic acid, the rate of this decline being positively correlated with the rate of increase in leaf water saturation deficit. Recovery from water stress was effected by immersing the leaf petioles in water while exposing the blades to high relative humidity. This resulted in a decrease in leaf water saturation deficit, a reduction in abscisic acid content, and an increase in gibberellin and cytokinin activity.Application of abscisic acid to the leaves caused partial stomatal closure in turgid lettuce leaves, whereas treatment with gibberellic acid and kinetin of such leaves had no effect on the stomatal aperture. In desiccating leaves, however, gibberellic acid and kinetin treatment considerably retarded stomatal closure, thus enhancing the increase in leaf water saturation deficit. These results suggest that the effect of desiccation in changing leaf hormonal make-up, i.e. a rapid increase in abscisic acid and a decrease in both cytokinin and gibberellin activity, is related to a mechanism designed to curtail water loss under conditions inducing water deficiency.",2020-05-01T17:19:15.086189,pubmed,3,41309511,233971200,Hormonal Activity in Detached Lettuce Leaves as Affected by Leaf Water Content,1169-73,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0032-0889,plant-physiology,Plant Physiol.,Plant Physiology,1588353555,59,1,N Aharoni,2,A Blumenfeld,1977-06-01T00:00:00,1588353555,hormonal-activity-in-detached-lettuce-leaves-as-affected-by-leaf-water-content,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC542528,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1104/pp.59.6.1169,2020-05-01T17:19:15.086189,,,,,,,,,A E Richmond,,,,,,,,,,,,276,3.71,,,,,,,,,,3,A E Richmond,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,16660015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ou-Yang Fu,Ming-Feng Hou,"This study demonstrated a cell line-specific effect of hypoxia on invasive potential and differential expression of constitutive MMPs in primary versus metastatic breast cancer cells, i.e. primary cancer cells expressed a wider range of MMPs, in particular MMP-2, -7 and -9, than the metastatic ones. The data suggest that MMPs play no crucial roles in hypoxia-induced tumor progression in primary breast cancer cells. CoCl(2)-induced hypoxia induced HIF-1alpha protein expression in all four cell lines. Hypoxia significantly increased the invasiveness of HCC1395 cells, which did not correlate with a change of any one MMP. Constitutive MMP expression was different between primary and metastatic breast cancer cells. MMP-2 and MMP-9 measured by RT-PCR and zymography were notably expressed in primary cancer cells but not apparent in metastatic ones. MMP-7 was also highly expressed in primary cancer cells. Hypoxia increased the expression of MMP-1, -10 and -13 in metastatic breast cancer cells, whereas only MMP-13 was up-regulated in primary HCC1937 cells by hypoxic stimulation. TIMPs were not altered by hypoxia, except for TIMP-4 which was down-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. The effect of cobalt chloride (CoCl(2))-stimulated hypoxia on invasion potential and the expression of MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were investigated in four breast cancer cell lines, derived from primary sites (HCC1395 and HCC1937) and metastatic sites (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231).

O L Petchey,,"Single-species populations of ciliates (Colpidium and Paramecium) experienced constant temperature or white or reddened temperature fluctuations in aquatic microcosms in order to test three hypotheses about how environmental colour influences population dynamics. (i) Models predict that the colour of population dynamics is tinged by the colour of the environmental variability. However, environmental colour had no effect on the colour of population dynamics. All population dynamics in this experiment were reddened, regardless of environmental colour. (ii) Models predict that populations will track reddened environmental variability more closely than white environmental variability and that populations with a higher intrinsic growth rate (r) will track environmental variability more closely than populations with a low r. The experimental populations behaved as predicted. (iii) Models predict that population variability is determined by interaction between r and the environmental variability. The experimental populations behaved as predicted. These results show that (i) reddened population dynamics may need no special explanation, such as reddened environments, spatial subdivision or interspecific interactions, and (ii) and (iii) that population dynamics are sensitive to environmental colour, in agreement with population models.

T Knottenberg,H Scheibner,"The Abney effect states that desaturation of spectral colours does not only change their chromatic saturation but also their hue. By means of Hering's perceptual criteria ""neither blue nor yellow"" and ""neither green nor red"" and heterochromatic brightness matching, chromaticity loci were measured in a visual tri-stimulus colorimeter; the loci served for construction of an opponent-colour triangle and the associated opponent-colour space. The chromaticity line resulting from the perceptual criterion ""neither green nor red"" deviated markedly--as an expression of the Abney effect--from a straight line. This phenomenon was captured by piecewise linearizing. The transformation of the (known) fundamental colour space, which may be interpreted as a cone excitation space, onto the opponent colour space thus gained yielded an explicit opponent-colour theory that reproduces some aspects of the Abney effect.",2020-05-01T00:10:19.674019,pubmed,2,34008184,733622400,Reference to the Abney Effect within the Scope of Linear Opponent-Color Theory,155-60,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,der-ophthalmologe-zeitschrift-der-deutschen-ophthalmologischen-gesellschaft,Ophthalmologe,Der Ophthalmologe : Zeitschrift Der Deutschen Ophthalmologischen Gesellschaft,1588291819,90,1,T Knottenberg,2,H Scheibner,1993-04-01T00:00:00,1588291819,reference-to-the-abney-effect-within-the-scope-of-linear-opponent-color-theory,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8490298,,,,,2020-05-01T00:10:19.674019,english-abstract,english abstract,,,english-abstract,english abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Giuseppe Comi,Sandi Orlic,"The aim of this study is to define the mould strains growing on the surface during the pre-ripening and the ripening phases of Istrian ham, and their toxic potential. The mould microflora was predominantly represented by five genera, which were isolated on the ham surfaces of three different producers investigated. The identified species were similar in the both tested periods, demonstrating that the contamination came mainly from the air and the ripening chambers (seasoning rooms), rather than the raw meat. Eurotium spp., Aspergillus spp. and Penicillium spp. were the main strains isolated. The presence and growth of the different strains depended on the temperature of ripening and the relative humidity in the ripening chambers, since the hams were home made products and not matured in controlled conditions. The toxic potential of isolated strains was also investigated. None of the tested moulds can produce mycotoxins and for this reason the Istrian hams do not represent a health hazard.",2020-05-01T17:24:14.022682,pubmed,5,41450047,1096588800,Moulds Isolated from Istrian Dried Ham at the Pre-Ripening and Ripening Level,29-34,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0168-1605,international-journal-of-food-microbiology,Int.

H J Mostert,R J Lund,"A theoretical integrative model was developed to determine the heat balance of horses working in a given environment. This model included the following parameters: metabolic heat gain, solar heat gain, evaporative heat loss due to sweating, respiratory tract heat loss, radiation from the body and heat gain or loss due to convection and conduction. The model developed in this study includes an unique approach for estimating heat loss via evaporation of sweat from the animal's skin surface. Previous studies modelling evaporative heat dissipation were based on the volume of sweat loss. While it is known that the ambient conditions affect evaporation rate, these effects have not been adequately described. The present model assumes the horse's skin surface is adequately represented by a body of water and it describes the interaction of that water body with the atmosphere. It is assumed that sweat has thermodynamic characteristics equivalent to distilled water. Sweat, however, has high electrolyte and protein concentrations and anecdotal evidence has shown that the thermodynamic characteristics may be significantly affected. Further research is, therefore, required to confirm these characteristics for equine sweat. The model describes all factors known to affect the thermal balance of the horse working in a given environment. The relative significance of the various variables on the whole integrative model has been illustrated. The effect of ambient temperature and humidity on the evaporative heat loss, the most significant and critical avenue of heat dissipation, is defined and quantified. The model illustrates clearly how increasing relative humidity limits evaporative heat loss, which can be further compromised when horses exercise on treadmills with no air movement.",2020-05-01T00:28:19.744700,pubmed,4,34140437,836179200,Integrative Model for Predicting Thermal Balance in Exercising Horses,7-15,22,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,equine-veterinary-journal-supplement,Equine Vet J Suppl,Equine Veterinary Journal.

A Chaparro,C F Stromeyer,"It has been argued by Watson, Barlow and Robson that the visual stimulus that humans detect best specifies the spatial-temporal structure of the receptive field of the most sensitive visual neurons. To investigate 'what the eye sees best' they used stimuli that varied in luminance alone. Because the most abundant primate retinal ganglion cells, the P cells, are colour-opponent, we might expect that a coloured pattern would also be detected well. We generalized Watson et al.'s study to include variations in colour as well as luminance. We report here that our best detected coloured stimulus was seen 5-9-fold better than our best luminance spot and 3-8-fold better than Watson's best luminance stimulus. The high sensitivity to colour is consistent with the prevalence and high colour contrast-gain of retinal P cells, and may compensate for the low chromatic contrasts typically found in natural scenes.",2020-05-01T00:15:43.714851,pubmed,5,34047274,728179200,Colour is what the Eye Sees Best,348-50,6410,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0028-0836,nature,Nature,Nature,1588292143,361,1,A Chaparro,2,C F Stromeyer,1993-01-28T00:00:00,1588292143,colour-is-what-the-eye-sees-best,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1038/361348a0,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8426653,2020-05-01T00:15:43.714851,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,E P Huang,R E Kronauer,R T Eskew,academic,Americas,US,United States,,,,harvard-university,Harvard University,1096,16.345,academic,Americas,US,United States,,,,harvard-university,Harvard University,3,E P Huang,4,R E Kronauer,,,,,5,,R T Eskew,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-six patients participated in a 2-center double-blind, 3-way comparative parallel 6-week clinical study. Patients were evaluated at 0, 2, and 6 weeks for tactile (Yeaple probe), air sensitivity (dental air syringe), and subjective perception of pain (VAS scores). Results for Yeaple probe scores (Wilcoxon tests) between 2 weeks and baseline were highly significant for KCl/MFP, significant for NaMFP and nonsignificant for SrAc2F; scores between 6 weeks and baseline were, however, highly significant for all groups. Subjective Yeaple probe VAS scores (paired t-tests) between 6 weeks and baseline were significant for all groups; significance was demonstrated in the KCl/MFP group between 2 weeks and baseline. Subjective air visual analogue scores (paired t-tests) between 2 weeks and baseline were highly significant for all groups. There were no significant differences between groups at any time point.

T Nakajima,E Azuma,"The aggravation of bronchial asthma in today's urban child population was studied by an epidemiological study in order to elucidate the involvement of indoor air pollution in relation to housing style. The asthma group consisted of 210 children under 12 years old who had been recently diagnosed as having bronchial asthma and under the care of Osaka Prefectural Habikino Hospital. The non-asthma group consisted of 180 children under 12 years old who had been under care at Osaka Prefectural Hospital but had no present history of allergic symptom. The individual atmospheric environment and housing style were surveyed by questionnaire. Also, the amount of mite allergen (Dp: Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Df: Dermatophagoides farinae) in room and bedding dust and the concentration of cotinine in urine were examined as objective indicators for the load of environmental allergen and the indoor air pollution by tobacco smoke, respectively. In this study, bronchial asthma was classified into two types: atopic/non-atopic, according to whether Dp-specific immunoglobulin E (Dp-IgE) was present/absent (positive/negative). Thus, for the risk factors given above, their involvement in each type of asthma was examined by comparing the proportion of the exposed subjects between the three groups of atopic asthma, non-atopic asthma and non-asthma. As atopy is an important factor of child asthma, the relative risk (odds ratio) of Dp-IgE increase (atopy) was also determined for the same factors by logistic regression analysis in each of the asthma and non-asthma groups. The results are as follows: 1. Reinforced concrete housing material, which results in mal-ventilation, increased the load of indoor air pollutants such as tobacco smoke. 2. A higher amount of mite allergen in bedding dust increased Dp-IgE. 3. Heating with stove, which results in a higher room humidity as well as temperature, enhanced Dp proliferation and appeared to be involved in increasing the risk of atopic asthma. 4. Reinforced concrete housing material appeared to be involved in suppressing Dp-IgE and increasing the risk of non-atopic asthma. But some air pollutants such as tobacco smoke and mite allergen showed no relationship to these involvements.",2020-05-01T02:28:14.661726,pubmed,6,34996408,893980800,Factors Aggravating Bronchial Asthma in Urban Children (I)--The Involvement of Indoor Air Pollution,407-22,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,nihon-koshu-eisei-zasshi-japanese-journal-of-public-health,Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi,[Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi] Japanese Journal of Public Health,1588300094,45,1,T Nakajima,2,E Azuma,1998-05-01T00:00:00,1588300094,factors-aggravating-bronchial-asthma-in-urban-children-i-the-involvement-of-indoor-air-pollution,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9739594,,,,,2020-05-01T02:28:14.661726,english-abstract,english abstract,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,english-abstract,english abstract,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,M Hashimoto,K Toyoshima,M Hayashida,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,M Hashimoto,4,K Toyoshima,,,,,5,,M Hayashida,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y Komachi,,,,6,Y Komachi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aqueous colloidal suspension of alpha-hydroxide of nickel/cobalt was obtained on washing the precipitate as the pH was reduced to approximately 7.

S A Sattar,K D Dimock,"Enterovirus 70 (EV-70) has caused at least two pandemics and several major epidemics of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC) in the past 18 years, with the largest number of cases occurring in the coastal areas of the tropics. The exact means of its spread are not known, but fomites and hands contaminated by them are the most likely vehicles. We, therefore, tested EV-70 survival under different environmental conditions using stainless steel disks (1 cm diameter). Each disk received 10 microliter of the virus in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The disks were held at various temperatures with the relative humidity (RH) at the low (20 +/- 5%), medium (50 +/- 5%), high (80 +/- 5%), or ultrahigh (95 +/- 5%) level. The virus was eluted from the disks with tryptose phosphate broth and the eluate assayed in LLC-MK2cells. Inactivation rates (Ki), expressed as hourly loss of virus plaque forming units (PFU) in log10, were then calculated. At 20 degrees C, virus survival was proportional to the RH level, with the highest virus survival at the ultrahigh RH; at this level nearly 5% of the input virus was detectable even after 24 hr. Virus inactivation rates were only slightly higher at the ultrahigh RH when the temperature was raised to 33 degrees C or 35 degrees C. However, at 80% RH, increasing the temperature from 20 degrees C to 33 degrees C resulted in a dramatic rise in virus inactivation.

A Fortin,J Allard,"In postoperative patients at high risk for neck relapse, cobalt seems to give a better neck control. We are currently doing a prospective study in which a bolus is added for half the treatment when patients at high risk for neck relapse are treated with 6 MV. Radical radiotherapy: A better local control (LC) is observed with 6 MV than with cobalt, but neck control was similar. Postoperative radiotherapy: A better LC is observed with 6 MV. In high-risk patients, the neck control was higher for the cobalt group (79%) vs 60% for the 6-MV group (p = .09 and .03 in a Cox model). A retrospective study including all of 1,452 consecutive patients treated by definitive or postoperative radiotherapy between 1989 and 1997. All stages and subsites of the head/neck were included. Local and neck control were evaluated by the Kaplan Meier method, and comparisons were made between the cobalt and the 6-MV subgroups with a subsequent Cox analysis. For neck control analysis, the postoperative patients were divided in low and high risk (extracapsular extension [ECE], >two nodes, or T4). Since 1992, we have been using a 6-MV linear accelerator instead of a cobalt machine. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of this on neck control, particularly on postoperative patients in which subcutaneous tissues are at risk.",2020-05-01T06:54:30.664209,pubmed,4,36911979,983404800,Outcome of Patients Treated with Cobalt and 6 Mv in Head and Neck Cancers,181-8,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,head-neck,Head Neck,Head & Neck,1588316070,23,1,A Fortin,2,J Allard,2001-03-01T00:00:00,1588316070,outcome-of-patients-treated-with-cobalt-and-6-mv-in-head-and-neck-cancers,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1002/1097-0347(200103)23:3<181::aid-hed1016>3.0.co;2-8,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11428447,2020-05-01T06:54:30.664209,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,M Albert,J Roy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,M Albert,4,J Roy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Junye Liu,Jing Zhang,"Hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), the key mediator of hypoxia signaling pathways, has been shown involved in hypoxia-induced radioresistance. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The present study demonstrated that both hypoxia and hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride could increase the radioresistance of human cervical cancer Hela cells. Meanwhile, ectopic expression of HIF-1 could enhance the resistance of Hela cells to radiation, whereas knocking-down of HIF-1 could increase the sensitivity of Hela cells to radiation in the presence of hypoxia. N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2), a new HIF-1 target gene identified in our lab, was found to be upregulated by hypoxia and radiation in a HIF-1-dependent manner. Overexpression of NDRG2 resulted in decreased sensitivity of Hela cells to radiation while silencing NDRG2 led to radiosensitization. Moreover, NDRG2 was proved to protect Hela cells from radiation-induced apoptosis and abolish radiation-induced upregulation of Bax. Taken together, these data suggest that both HIF-1 and NDRG2 contribute to hypoxia-induced tumor radioresistance and that NDRG2 acts downstream of HIF-1 to promote radioresistance through suppressing radiation-induced Bax expression. It would be meaningful to further explore the clinical application potential of HIF-1 and NDRG2 blockade as radiosensitizer for tumor therapy.",2020-05-02T02:33:06.829557,pubmed,9,45013725,1279152000,Hif-1 and Ndrg2 Contribute to Hypoxia-Induced Radioresistance of Cervical Cancer Hela Cells,1985-93,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0014-4827,experimental-cell-research,Exp.

R D Hansen,T S Olds,"Infrared (IR) thermometers (FirstTemp 2000A, Intelligent Medical Systems, California) were used to monitor tympanic temperature (Tty) in 12 collapsed fun-runners suspected of suffering exertion-induced heat exhaustion (EIHE). Rectal temperature (Tre) was monitored via digital clinical thermometers. Conditions during the fun-run and in the field treatment centre were cool (air temperature 16-18 degrees C, relative humidity 60-65%). On admission, Tty was (mean +/- SEM) 1.2 +/- 0.3 degrees C lower than Tre. For admission plus subsequent monitoring data pooled, although Tty correlated significantly with Tre (r = 0.86, p or = 37.1 degrees C predicted a Tre > or = 38 degrees C (an established diagnostic criterion for EIHE) with a sensitivity of 0.93 and a specificity of 0.63. These data indicate that IR tympanic thermometry, when utilised in cool environments, can result in misdiagnosis of heat exhaustion.

K Gaede,W Kn&Uuml;Lle,"The nascent salivary secretion of 41 partly dehydrated and unfed adult female Amblyomma variegatum, 5&shy;8 months post-ecdysis, during water vapour uptake at 93.5 % relative humidity and 20 &deg;C, had an osmolality of between 298.6 and 769.7 mosmol kg-1 (mean &plusmn; s.d. 470.3&plusmn;85.8 mosmol kg-1). This range would allow water vapour uptake at relative humidities of approximately 98&shy;99 %, but it would not suffice for lower relative humidities down to 80&shy;85 %, the critical equilibrium humidity of A. variegatum. At this relative humidity (85 %), an osmolality of 9796 mosmol kg-1 is required for water vapour uptake. It is proposed that hydrophilic cuticle in the hypostome could play a role in water condensation and that the slightly hyperosmotic secretion of the agranular alveoli of the salivary glands might alter the water affinity at the adsorbing cuticle surface and release the adsorbed water. The water-enriched secretion would then be drawn into the mouth by the powerful suction of the pharynx. This hypothetical hydrophilic cuticle component of water vapour uptake in A. variegatum merits closer investigation. The sorption kinetics of A. variegatum support an additional 'osmotic' component of water vapour uptake at humidities near saturation. A nanolitre osmometer particularly suited to sample volumes smaller than 5 nl was developed. This device does not require the transfer of fluid after collection, and its measurement range is extended beyond the 5 osmol kg-1 that can be measured using commercial apparatus.",2020-05-01T02:41:24.498592,pubmed,2,35092033,852076800,On the Mechanism of Water Vapour Sorption from Unsaturated Atmospheres by Ticks,1491-8,Pt 10,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-0949,the-journal-of-experimental-biology,J.

V R Goskonda,I K Reddy,"A tablet formulation containing dyphylline, Carbomer, magnesium stearate, talc and lactose was prepared by the direct compression method. The objective of the study was to assess the stability of these tablets after subjecting them to exaggerated conditions of temperature (4, 25, 37, 45 and 55 degrees C) and humidity (37 degrees/11%RH, 37 degrees/51%RH and 37 degrees C/91%RH). The samples were analyzed for crystalline, thermal and dissolution changes with time for a period of 12 months using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and U.S.P. Dissolution Apparatus 2. Moisture sorption studies of all tablets indicated sorption of large amounts of moisture at 37 degrees C/91%RH. The fit factors, f1 andf2, were calculated and used to compare the dissolution profiles.

Matthieu Lenoir,Joost Vansteenkiste,"The effects of three different colour patterns on the surface of volleyballs (versus that of a plain white ball) on the behaviour of a reception player were examined by presenting sidespin volleyball serves. Expert (n = 10) and novice (n = 10) volleyball players intercepted volleyballs projected straight at them or at an initial angle of 9.5 degrees outwards but eventually curving towards the players' original position. In the latter trajectories, players generally took one or more steps laterally before returning to the landing position of the ball. These excursion patterns were significantly more pronounced with the white balls than the coloured balls. Differences between balls of different colour combinations were also observed. The first finding supports the thesis that next to a prospective type of control, such as on-line maintenance of a certain spatiotemporal relationship between the player and the ball, properties of the ball itself allow prediction of the future path of the ball. Differences between types of colour patterns are explained within the framework of the between-colours wavelength contrasts of each type of ball.",2020-05-01T17:12:15.240131,pubmed,4,41121063,1122854400,Effects of Contrasting Colour Patterns of the Ball in the Volleyball Reception,871-9,8,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0264-0414,journal-of-sports-sciences,J Sports Sci,Journal of Sports Sciences,1588353135,23,1,Matthieu Lenoir,2,Joost Vansteenkiste,2005-08-01T00:00:00,1588353135,effects-of-contrasting-colour-patterns-of-the-ball-in-the-volleyball-reception,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,16195039,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1080/02640410400022722,2020-05-01T17:12:15.240131,comparative-study,comparative study,controlled-clinical-trial,controlled clinical trial,comparative-study,comparative study,controlled-clinical-trial,controlled clinical trial,Jelle Vermeulen,Dirk De Clercq,,academic,Europe,BE,Belgium,State University of Ghent,University of Ghent,Ugent,universiteit-gent,Universiteit Gent,117,1.227,academic,Europe,BE,Belgium,State University of Ghent,University of Ghent,Ugent,universiteit-gent,Universiteit Gent,3,Jelle Vermeulen,4,Dirk De Clercq,,,,,,,,TRUE,27476,Matthieu Lenoir,matthieu-lenoir,,,,,Ghent University,Ghent University,TRUE,27476,Matthieu Lenoir,matthieu-lenoir,matthieu-lenoir,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Frank Eperjesi,Colin W Fowler,"Coloured light filter overlays are unlikely to provide a clinically significant improvement in reading rates for people with non-exudative AMD associated with a relative scotoma and central fixation. Anova indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in reading rates with the coloured light filter overlays compared to the clear filter. Furthermore, chi-squared analysis indicated that the rose, purple and blue filters had a significantly poorer overall ranking in terms of reading rates compared to the other coloured and clear light filters. Using a prospective clinical trial design, we examined the null hypothesis that coloured light filter overlays do not improve reading rates in AMD when compared to a clear filter.

M Wall,P B Donzis,"Errors in AOPP colour plate detection may be due to loss of ability to perceive colour contrast and possibly luminance contrast. Using the cross-polarising filters, we found five plates that required more light to identify (plates 9-12, 15). In the second experiment, we found a significant relationship between the number missed of these five AOPP plates and a decrease in contrast sensitivity (r = 0.91, p < 0.001, Spearman correlation coefficient). We studied two groups of subjects. In 20 normal test subjects with no errors on the AOPP we used cross-polarising filters to darken and then gradually increase perceived luminance of the AOPP until these normal subjects correctly identified the plate. In a second group, to evaluate the relationship between a luminance contrast sensitivity score using Arden plates and AOPP identification, we tested 37 non-colour-deficient subjects who missed zero to five of the AOPP of low colour and luminance contrast (plates 9-12, 15).

L J Chen,P Colonna,"Contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler-automatic boundary detection was feasible and accurate in estimation of left ventricular volume and function in patients with poor acoustic windows. This technique significantly reduced inter-observer variability, thus improving reliability and confidence of investigators in left ventricular function assessment. Contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler-automatic boundary detection may have great potential in clinical evaluation of left ventricular volume and function, especially when on-line software is available. Twenty-six patients with more than two segments not clearly visualized in tissue harmonic imaging were studied with contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler using Levovist. Twenty patients (77%) achieved full left ventricular contrast filling without apparent blooming artefacts. Contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler-automatic boundary detection was successfully implemented in these 20 patients, despite three (15%) in which it was not possible to acquire more than three cardiac cycles' values. Contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler-automatic boundary detection measurements agreed closely with the manually drawn data. Among the three independent readers in the three techniques, the best correlation, lowest SEE, smallest limits of agreement and inter-observer variability were obtained in contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler-automatic boundary detection. Patients with poor quality echocardiograms impede the application of available automatic boundary detection technologies. Tissue harmonic imaging and contrast media can allow optimal differentiation of left ventricular blood pool and tissue, making it possible to utilize automatic boundary detection software for automatic non-operator-dependent computation of left ventricular volumes. We integrated contrast-enhanced harmonic colour Doppler with a semiautomated boundary detection algorithm to explore the feasibility, accuracy and inter-observer variability for left ventricular volume assessment in technically difficult patients.",2020-05-01T06:51:40.506248,pubmed,8,36890653,1007164800,"Quantification of Left Ventricular Function with Contrast-Enhanced Harmonic Colour Doppler and a Semiautomated Boundary Detection Algorithm in Technically Difficult Patients: Feasibility, Accuracy, and Inter-Observer Variability",253-61,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1525-2167,european-journal-of-echocardiography-the-journal-of-the-working-group-on-echocardiography-of-the-european-society-of-cardiology,Eur J Echocardiogr,European Journal of Echocardiography : the Journal of the Working Group on Echocardiography of the European Society of Cardiology,1588315900,2,1,L J Chen,2,P Colonna,2001-12-01T00:00:00,1588315900,quantification-of-left-ventricular-function-with-contrast-enhanced-harmonic-colour-doppler-and-a-semiautomated-boundary-detection-algorithm-in-technically-difficult-patients-feasibility-accuracy-and-inter-observer-variability,journal-article,journal article,,pii,,S1525-2167(01)90104-0,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11888819,2020-05-01T06:51:40.506248,,,,,,,,,C Cadeddu,A H Selem,R Montisci,academic,Europe,IT,Italy,Università Degli Studi Di Cagliari,University of Cagliari,,universita-degli-studi-di-cagliari,Universita Degli Studi Di Cagliari,,,academic,Europe,IT,Italy,Università Degli Studi Di Cagliari,University of Cagliari,,universita-degli-studi-di-cagliari,Universita Degli Studi Di Cagliari,3,C Cadeddu,4,A H Selem,,,,,5,,R Montisci,TRUE,180604,Paolo Colonna,paolo-colonna,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1053/euje.2001.0104,,,,,,,,C Caiati,L Meloni,,,6,C Caiati,7,L Meloni,S Iliceto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,180604,Paolo Colonna,paolo-colonna,paolo-colonna,8,S Iliceto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jarkko Hukkamäki,Sari Suvanto,"Mesoporous high surface area MCM-41 and SBA-15 type silica materials with fibrous morphology were synthesized and used as support materials for the ALCVD (atomic layer chemical vapor deposition) preparation of Co/MCM-41 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts. Co/MCM-41 and Co/SBA-15 catalysts were prepared by deposition of Co2(CO)8 from the gas phase onto the surfaces of preheated support materials in a fluidized bed reactor. For both silica materials, two different kinds of preparation methods, direct deposition and a pulse deposition method, were used. Pure silica supports as well as supported cobalt catalysts were characterized by various spectroscopic (IR) and analytical (X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, elemental analysis) methods. MCM-41 and SBA-15 fibers showed considerable ability to adsorb Co2(CO)8 from the gas phase. For MCM-41 and SBA-15 silicas, cobalt loadings of 13.7 and 12.1 wt % were obtained using the direct deposition method. The cobalt loadings increased to 23.0 and 20.7 wt % for MCM-41 and SBA-15 silicas, respectively, when the pulse deposition method was used. The reduction behavior of silica-supported cobalt catalysts was found to depend on the catalyst preparation method and on the mesoporous structure of the support material. Almost identical reduction properties of SBA-15-supported catalysts prepared by different deposition methods are explained by the structural properties of the mesoporous support and, in particular, by the chemical structure of the inner surfaces and walls of the mesopores. Pulse O2/H2 chemisorption experiments showed catalytically promising redox properties and surface stability of the prepared MCM-41- and SBA-15-supported cobalt catalysts.",2020-05-01T17:21:49.604223,pubmed,4,41383355,1099958400,Influence of the Pore Structure of Mcm-41 and Sba-15 Silica Fibers on Atomic Layer Chemical Vapor Deposition of Cobalt Carbonyl,10288-95,23,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0743-7463,langmuir-the-acs-journal-of-surfaces-and-colloids,Langmuir,Langmuir : the Acs Journal of Surfaces and Colloids,1588353709,20,1,Jarkko Hukkamäki,2,Sari Suvanto,2004-11-09T00:00:00,1588353709,influence-of-the-pore-structure-of-mcm-41-and-sba-15-silica-fibers-on-atomic-layer-chemical-vapor-deposition-of-cobalt-carbonyl,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15518527,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/la048610q,2020-05-01T17:21:49.604223,,,,,,,,,Mika Suvanto,Tuula T Pakkanen,,,,,,,,,,,300,1.209,,,,,,,,,,3,Mika Suvanto,4,Tuula T Pakkanen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

L R Tiruta-Barna,R Barna,"A physicochemical and transport model has been developed for the long term prediction of environmental leaching behavior of porous materials containing inorganic waste solidified with hydraulic binders and placed in a reuse scenario. The reuse scenario considered in the paper is a storage tank open to the atmosphere including material leaching with water and carbonation through the leachate contact with air. The model includes three levels: (i) the physicochemical pollution source term (chemical equilibria in the pore water and diffusion in the porous system); (ii) chemical equilibria and mass transfer in the tank; and (iii) gas/liquid transfer of carbon dioxide. The model was applied to the case of a material obtained through solidification of Air Pollution Control (APC) residues from Municipal Solid Waste Incinerator (MSWI). The simulation results are in good agreement with two scale experimental data: laboratory and field tests. Experimental data and simulations show the main trends for release of elements contained in the material: (i) the release of alkaline metals and chloride is not significantly influenced by carbonation and (ii) the release of Ca and Pb is governed by chemical equilibria in pore water and diffusion, while their speciation in the leachate is determined by pH and the presence of carbonate ions.",2020-05-01T05:29:10.875557,pubmed,3,36325899,978307200,Modeling of Solid/Liquid/Gas Mass Transfer for Environmental Evaluation of Cement-Based Solidified Waste,149-56,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0013-936X,environmental-science-technology,Environ.

Jacob Klenø Nøjgaard,Karl Bang Christensen,"Oxidation products of terpenes (e.g. limonene) contain unidentified irritants, which may be responsible for a fraction of the reported eye and airway complaints in indoor environments. Here we report exposure to parts per billion (ppb) levels of limonene oxidation products (LOPs) and the terpene oxidation product methacrolein using blink frequency (BF) as a measure of trigeminal stimulation of the human eye. Ten male subjects averaging 43 (standard deviation 10.5) years were exposed for 20 min to LOPs, methacrolein, and clean air, respectively. A baseline BF was measured prior to and following each exposure (8 min and 4 min, respectively). The subjects were exposed locally in the non-dominant eye and single blind at 20% relative humidity (RH), while viewing an educational film. Blinking was video recorded and evaluated for full sessions of 36 min. Mean BF increased significantly during exposure to LOPs and methacrolein compared to the baseline of clean air, and the findings coincided with weak eye irritation symptoms. Lowest observed effect levels were 286 ppb methacrolein and a 10-min-old LOPs mixture of initially 92 ppb limonene and 101 ppb ozone (O3), which increased the BF comparably by 18% (p=0.001) and 17% (p=0.003), respectively. The increase in BF was smaller, although not significantly different, during exposure to LOPs at 50% RH to 20% RH in mixtures prepared from ca. 350 ppb limonene and 300 ppb O3.

J D Hackney,W S Linn,"Observations of high acidity (pH as low as 1.7) in fogwater collected in polluted areas have provoked concern for public health. Effects of exposure to acidic pollutants have not been studied under foggy conditions; thus there is no directly relevant information from which to estimate the health risk. Indirectly relevant information is available from numerous studies of volunteers exposed to ""acid fog precursors"" under controlled conditions at less than 100% relative humidity. The effect of fog in modifying responses to inhaled acidic pollutants is difficult to predict: depending on circumstances, fog droplets might either increase or decrease the effective dose of pollutants to the lower respiratory tract. Fog inhalation per se may have unfavorable effects in some individuals. Sulfur dioxide is known to exacerbate airway constriction in exercising asthmatics, at exposure concentrations attainable in ambient air. Nitrogen dioxide has shown little untoward respiratory effect at ambient concentrations in most studies, although it has been suggested to increase bronchial reactivity. Sulfuric acid aerosol has shown no clear effects at concentrations within the ambient range. At somewhat higher levels, increased bronchial reactivity and change in mucociliary clearance have been suggested.

J Laarni,,"In the present study I compared the effect of colour and location cues on the selection of a target. Two questions were in focus. First, can both colour and location cues trigger and mediate attentional selection, and if they can, which of them is more effective? Second, does physical distinctiveness between a target and a distractor have to be taken into account? In two experiments, in which the most likely target colour or location was cued, both colour cues and arrow-like location cues produced cue-validity effects. The relative effectiveness of feature cues and location cues appeared, to some extent, to be dependent on target-distractor confusability. Taken together, the results support the post-categorical filter theory, in which different cues can be used to trigger the feedback loop that is used to address relevant identity information via location.",2020-05-01T03:34:10.080156,pubmed,1,35513509,944006400,Allocating Attention in the Visual Field: the Effects of Cue Type and Target-Distractor Confusability,281-94,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0001-6918,acta-psychologica,Acta Psychol (Amst),Acta Psychologica,1588304050,103,1,J Laarni,,,1999-12-01T00:00:00,1588304050,allocating-attention-in-the-visual-field-the-effects-of-cue-type-and-target-distractor-confusability,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10668301,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/s0001-6918(99)00045-1,2020-05-01T03:34:10.080156,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,,,,academic,Europe,FI,Finland,Helsingfors Universitet,Helsingin Yliopisto Keskustakampuksen,University of Helsinki,helsingin-yliopisto,Helsingin Yliopisto,88,1.161,academic,Europe,FI,Finland,Helsingfors Universitet,Helsingin Yliopisto Keskustakampuksen,University of Helsinki,helsingin-yliopisto,Helsingin Yliopisto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Helsinki City Centre Campus,University of Helsinki City Centre Campus,,,,,,,,Centre of Excellence in Global Governance Research,Centre of Excellence in Global Governance Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A H Hopman,S Claessen,"We describe the brightfield microscopical detection of multiple DNA target sequences in cell and tissue preparations. For this purpose, chromosome-specific DNA probes labelled with biotin, digoxigenin or fluorescein were simultaneously hybridised and detected by enzyme cytochemistry using two horseradish peroxidase (PO) reactions and one alkaline phosphatase (APase) reaction. For triple-colour detection on single cell preparations, the combination of the enzyme precipitates PO/diaminobenzidine (DAB, brown colour), APase/fast red (FR, red colour) and PO/tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, green colour) resulted in an accurate detection of DNA targets. Embedding of the preparations in a thin cross-linked protein layer further stabilised the enzyme reaction products. For in situ hybridisation on tissue sections, however, this detection procedure showed some limitations with respect to both the stability of the APase/FR and PO/TMB precipitates, and the sequence of immunochemical layers in multiple-target procedures. For this reason, the APase/FR reaction was replaced by the APase/new fuchsin (NF, red colour) reaction and the washing steps after the PO/TMB reaction were restricted to the use of phosphate buffer pH 6.0. Furthermore, to improve the efficiency of the ISH reaction, APase/NF was applied in an avidin-biotin complex detection system and, to avoid target shielding in the triple-target ISH, the third primary antibody was applied prior to the second enzyme cytochemical reaction. These adaptations resulted in stable, well contrasting brown, red and green coloured precipitates. After quick haematoxylin counterstaining, the tissue preparations were directly mounted in phosphate buffer and, optionally, embedded in the cross-linked protein layer.",2020-05-01T02:28:17.949208,pubmed,3,34996840,,Multi-Colour Brightfield in Situ Hybridisation on Tissue Sections,291-8,4-5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0948-6143,histochemistry-and-cell-biology,Histochem.

André Roemgens,Shilpee Singh,"Oxygen is the ultimate electron acceptor for mitochondrial respiration, a process catalyzed by cytochrome c oxidase (COX). In mammals, oxygen concentration regulates gene transcription of COX subunit IV isoforms. Here, we demonstrate that chemical hypoxia, i.e. inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by application of the COX inhibitors cobalt, cyanide, and azide, affects COX isoform IV-1 and IV-2 transcription in a gender- and brain region-specific way. After treatment with cyanide and cobalt, female cortical and mesencephalic astrocytes, respectively, revealed an up-regulation of COX IV-2 which was accompanied by increased ROS production and necrotic cell death. In male astrocytes, the ratio of COX IV-1/COX IV-2 was lowest after treatment with cobalt and paralleled by highest levels of ROS production and necrosis. These results support the view of a causal correlation of COX IV-2 transcription with cellular oxidative stress and cell death and highlight a gender specificity of these effects. By comparing three toxins, cobalt represented the most potent inducer of overall cell death and resembled most closely the previously observed effects of oxygen deprivation on decreasing the cox4i1/cox4i2 ratio. Overall, an increased sensitivity of male compared with female cell viability towards the toxins was detected. These regulatory responses might be causative for the known gender specificity of toxic and neurodegenerative processes in the brain.",2020-05-02T02:11:16.183508,pubmed,4,44810805,1309478400,Inducers of Chemical Hypoxia Act in a Gender- and Brain Region-Specific Manner on Primary Astrocyte Viability and Cytochrome C Oxidase,1-14,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1029-8428,neurotoxicity-research,Neurotox Res,Neurotoxicity Research,1588385476,20,1,André Roemgens,2,Shilpee Singh,2011-07-01T00:00:00,1588385476,inducers-of-chemical-hypoxia-act-in-a-gender-and-brain-region-specific-manner-on-primary-astrocyte-viability-and-cytochrome-c-oxidase,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/s12640-010-9213-z,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20734249,2020-05-02T02:11:16.183508,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Cordian Beyer,Susanne Arnold,,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,Rwth Aachen University,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Rwth,rheinisch-westfalische-technische-hochschule-aachen,Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen,65,0.941,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,Rwth Aachen University,Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule Aachen,Rwth,rheinisch-westfalische-technische-hochschule-aachen,Rheinisch-Westfalische Technische Hochschule Aachen,3,Cordian Beyer,4,Susanne Arnold,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the course of such studies on azalea, we observed a correlation between flower colour patterns, flower morphology and somatic polyploidy. Using high-resolution flow cytometry of nuclear DNA, the ploidy level was determined in flowers of different azalea sport families. Sports exhibiting variegated flowers with broad (> 7mm), differently coloured, petal edges (picotee type) proved to be tetraploid in the petal edge while diploid in the rest of the flower tissue. Neither flower colour pattern nor ploidy differences are chimeral in origin, but seem to be correlated with the topographic location of the cells within the flower tissue, i.e. the margin of the petals.

M Lipsett,S Hurley,"During the winters of 1986-1987 through 1991-1992, rainfall throughout much of Northern California was subnormal, resulting in intermittent accumulation of air pollution, much of which was attributable to residential wood combustion (RWC).

Emergency room (ER) records from three acute-care hospitals were abstracted to compile daily visits for asthma and a control diagnosis (gastroenteritis) for 3-month periods during each winter. Air monitoring data included daily coefficient of haze (COH) and every-other-day particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 microns (PM10, 24-hr average), as well as hourly nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations. Daily COH measurements were used to predict values for missing days of PM10 to develop a complete PM10 time series. Daily data were also obtained for temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity. In time-series analyses using Poisson regression, consistent relationships were found between ER visits for asthma and PM10. Same-day nitrogen dioxide concentrations were also associated with asthma ER visits, while ozone was not. Because there was a significant interaction between PM10 and minimum temperature in this data set, estimates of relative risks (RRs) for PM10-associated asthma ER visits were temperature-dependent. A 60 micrograms/m3 change in PM10 (2-day lag) corresponded to RRs of 1.43 (95% CI = 1.18-1.69) at 20 degrees F, representing the low end of the temperature distribution, 1.27 (95% CI = 1.13-1.42) at 30 degrees F, and 1.11 (95% CI = 1.03-1.19) at 41 degrees F, the mean of the observed minimum temperature. ER visits for gastroenteritis were not significantly associated with any pollutant variable. Several sensitivity analyses, including the use of robust regressions and of nonparametric methods for fitting time trends and temperature effects in the data, supported these findings. These results demonstrate an association between ambient wintertime PM10 and exacerbations of asthma in an area where one of the principal sources of PM10 is RWC.",2020-05-01T02:47:01.694960,pubmed,3,35134638,854755200,"Air Pollution and Emergency Room Visits for Asthma in Santa Clara County, California",216-22,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0091-6765,environmental-health-perspectives,Environ.

F L Laksmana,P J A Hartman Kok,"Next to the coating formulation, process conditions play important roles in determining coating quality. This study aims to develop an operational window that separates layering from agglomeration regimes and, furthermore, the one that leads to the best coating quality in a fluidized bed coater. The bed relative humidity and the droplet size of the coating aerosol were predicted using a set of engineering models. The coating quality was characterized using a quantitative image analysis method, which measures the coating thickness distribution, the total porosity, and the pore size in the coating. The layering regime can be achieved by performing the coating process at a certain excess of the viscous Stokes number (DeltaSt(v)). This excess is dependent on the given bed relative humidity and droplet size. The higher the bed relative humidity, the higher is the DeltaSt(v) required to keep the process in the layering regime. Further, it is shown that using bed relative humidity and droplet size alone is not enough to obtain constant coating quality. The changes in bed relative humidity and droplet size have been identified to correlate to the fractional area of particles sprayed per unit of time. This parameter can effectively serve as an additional parameter to be considered for a better control on the coating quality. High coating quality is shown to be achieved by performing the process close to saturation and spraying droplets small enough to obtain high spraying rate, but not too small to cause incomplete coverage of the core particles.",2020-05-02T01:52:45.448824,pubmed,5,44645997,1230768000,Development and Application of a Process Window for Achieving High-Quality Coating in a Fluidized Bed Coating Process,732-42,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1530-9932,aaps-pharmscitech,AAPS PharmSciTech,Aaps Pharmscitech,1588384365,10,1,F L Laksmana,2,P J A Hartman Kok,2009-01-01T00:00:00,1588384365,development-and-application-of-a-process-window-for-achieving-high-quality-coating-in-a-fluidized-bed-coating-process,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC2802158,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19495990,2020-05-02T01:52:45.448824,,,,,,,,,H Vromans,H W Frijlink,K Van Der Voort Maarschalk,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,Rug,University of Groningen,,rijksuniversiteit-groningen,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,71,0.162,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,Rug,University of Groningen,,rijksuniversiteit-groningen,Rijksuniversiteit Groningen,3,H Vromans,4,H W Frijlink,,,,,5,,K Van Der Voort Maarschalk,,,,,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1208/s12249-009-9250-1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
V Belkin,G Livshits,"Hand radiograms for osseographic assessment of bone aging status were taken from more than 7,500 individuals residing in 31 different localities and belonging to 20 ethnic groups. Multiple regression analysis was used to evaluate possible associations between bone aging parameters and several climatic factors, to wit: hours of daylight in January and July, average monthly humidity and partial vapor pressure in January and July, and one climatic index pertaining to comfort conditions in life, namely, the Bioclimatic Index of Severity of Climatic Regime. Multiple regression analysis clearly pointed to significant correlations between climatic characteristics and indices defining the relative rate of bone aging in humans; it also evinced an independent contribution of July's humidity and January's mean temperature to earliest age at which first signs of bone aging can be found. In sum, there are grounds for concluding that temperature and humidity are key factors in triggering initial bone changes in individuals within the human populations prone to environmental effects. The combination of humidity and temperature with other factors which reflect the sharpness of the interseasonal differences in climatic conditions predispose the populations to early onset of bone changes.",2020-05-01T00:48:44.053639,pubmed,4,34288550,899251200,Aging Bone Score and Climatic Factors,349-59,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0002-9483,american-journal-of-physical-anthropology,Am.

J Krzystek,S A Zvyagin,"A tunable-frequency methodology based on backward wave oscillator sources in high-frequency and -field EPR (HFEPR) is described. This methodology is illustrated by an application to three non-Kramers transition metal ion complexes and one Kramers ion complex. The complexes are of: Ni(II) (S=1) as found in dichlorobistriphenylphosphanenickel(II), Mn(III) (S=2) as found in mesotetrasulfonatoporphyrinatomanganese(III) chloride, Fe(II) (S=2) as found in ferrous sulfate tetrahydrate, and Co(II) (S=3/2) as found in azido(tris(3-tert-butylpyrazol-1-yl)hydroborate)cobalt(II). The above Ni(II) and Mn(III) complexes have been studied before by HFEPR using the multifrequency methodology based on Gunn oscillator sources, but not by the present method, while the Fe(II) and Co(II) complexes presented here have not been studied by any form of HFEPR. Highly accurate spin Hamiltonian parameters can be obtained by the experimental methodology described here, in combination with automated fitting procedures. This method is particularly successful in determining g-matrix parameters, which are very difficult to extract for high-spin systems from single frequency (or a very limited set of multi-frequency) HFEPR spectra, but is also able to deliver equally accurate values of the zero-field splitting tensor. The experimental methods involve either conventional magnetic field modulation or an optical modulation of the sub-THz wave beam. The relative merits of these and other experimental methods are discussed.",2020-05-01T17:11:50.957074,pubmed,5,41110629,1138752000,Tunable-Frequency High-Field Electron Paramagnetic Resonance,174-83,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1090-7807,journal-of-magnetic-resonance-san-diego-calif-1997,J.

Dorit Wenke,Stephen M Fleming,"The experience of controlling one's own actions, and through them events in the outside world, is a pervasive feature of human mental life. Two experiments investigated the relation between this sense of control and the internal processes involved in action selection and cognitive control. Action selection was manipulated by subliminally priming left or right keypress actions in response to a supraliminal visual target. The action caused the display of one of several colours as an action effect. The specific colour shown depended on whether the participant's action was compatible or incompatible with the preceding subliminal prime, and not on the prime identity alone. Unlike previous studies, therefore, the primes did not predict the to-be-expected action effects. Participants rated how much control they experienced over the different colours. Replicating previous results, compatible primes facilitated responding, whereas incompatible primes interfered with response selection. Crucially, priming also modulated the sense of control over action effects: participants experienced more control over colours produced by actions that were compatible with the preceding prime than over colours associated with prime-incompatible actions. Experiment 2 showed that this effect was not solely due to priming modulating action-effect contingencies. These results suggest that sense of control is linked to processes of selection between alternative actions, being strongest when selection is smooth and uncontested.",2020-05-02T01:59:57.547709,pubmed,3,44713754,1270080000,Subliminal Priming of Actions Influences Sense of Control over Effects of Action,26-38,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0010-0277,cognition,Cognition,Cognition,1588384797,115,1,Dorit Wenke,2,Stephen M Fleming,2010-04-01T00:00:00,1588384797,subliminal-priming-of-actions-influences-sense-of-control-over-effects-of-action,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19945697,,pii,,S0010-0277(09)00269-8,2020-05-02T01:59:57.547709,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Patrick Haggard,,,,,,,,,,,,165,2.7,,,,,,,,,,3,Patrick Haggard,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,143875,Patrick Haggard,patrick-haggard,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/j.cognition.2009.10.016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,United Kingdom,action-and-body-research-group,Action and Body Research Group,,,,action-and-body-research-group,Action and Body Research Group,,,TRUE,6570331,Stephen Fleming,stephen-fleming-7127588c1990459990c1761040ee321d,stephen-fleming-7127588c1990459990c1761040ee321d,,,,,,,TRUE,6570331,Stephen Fleming,stephen-fleming-7127588c1990459990c1761040ee321d,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,143875,Patrick Haggard,patrick-haggard,patrick-haggard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E Sabbioni,C Minoia,"Biological monitoring of Co, Ta and W, using mainly neutron activation analysis, was carried out on the urine, blood, pubic hair and toe nails of 251 subjects occupationally exposed to hard metal dusts (23 individuals were diagnosed as 'diseased subjects', affected by asthma and/or lung fibrosis). Airborne dust at hard metal workplaces were also analyzed for Co and W content. Cobalt and tungsten exposure at workplaces varied widely and frequently exceeded the TLV (0.05 mg Co/m3). Cobalt in urine (CoU), which is better than Co in blood (CoB), could represent a valuable indicator in discriminating between exposed groups, but is of little value as an indicator of exposure for single individuals. The high concentrations of cobalt in public hair (CoH) and toe nails (CoN) could also be valuable indicators of exposure although they are not useful, however, in establishing quantitatively the levels of cobalt accumulation. Tungsten and tantalum in pubic hair (WH and TaH) and toe nails (WN and TaN) also seem to be useful indicators in proving hard metal exposure qualitatively. The determination of these two elements, rather than cobalt, in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is very useful in complementing the diagnosis of hard metal disease proving hard metal exposure. The analysis of the BAL subfractions showed that W and Ta were firmly incorporated into the macrophage fraction while Co was distributed between cellular fraction and supernatant, which suggests a different mobility of hard metals in pulmonary tissue. The metal concentrations determined when submitted to statistical analysis indicated a positive correlation with P < 0.001 for the pairs (CoB-CoU), (Co-W) in urine, and (Co-W) in toe nails. Multielement analysis of biological specimens from diseased subjects suggests that hard metal disease does not relate to Co, W and Ta levels in the specimens considered. The disease does not depend on sex, age, working age and length of hard metal exposure. These findings support the theory on the possible haptenic properties of Co which may induce hypersensitivity and immuno-related toxic effects.",2020-04-30T23:08:54.044005,pubmed,6,33544651,772934400,Metal Determinations in Biological Specimens of Diseased and Non-Diseased Hard Metal Workers,41-54,1-3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0048-9697,the-science-of-the-total-environment,Sci.

Therapeutic electrons of 12, 15, 18, and 20 MeV from Clinic 18 and 20 accelerators have been produced at ultralow dose rates. Details of the experimental methods have been described previously by the authors. Single-event lineal energy spectra for these beams, as measured by a Rossi chamber differ significantly from cobalt-60 both in shape and dose average lineal energy (yd) which, depending on electron energy, can be 20-40% lower. The spectral peaks for electrons are greatly enhanced compared to cobalt. The yd for electrons also differs from previously reported values for 10-15 MV photon beams. These differences are less pronounced than for differences with cobalt. Spectral peaks and shapes correlate well with the actual electron stopping powers in tissue.

M Schmiedeskamp,R E Klevit,"The minimal DNA-binding domain of the yeast ADR1 transcription factor consists of two Cys2-His2 zinc fingers and an additional 20 residues N-terminal and proximal to the fingers. The accessory sequence likely plays a role in contacting DNA. Paramagnetic cobalt was incorporated into the fingers of an ADR1 DNA-binding construct (ADR1z) to serve as a probe of the proximity of the accessory sequence to the zinc fingers. NMR signals from the accessory region are not perturbed by cobalt incorporation. Previous studies showed that this region is random coil in the ADR1z construct in the absence of DNA; it does not adopt a fixed orientation with respect to the cobalt sites. In contrast, many residues of the accessory region are perturbed by cobalt in the DNA-bound form of the protein, suggesting this region becomes constrained. This observation agrees with previous results showing a disorder-to-order transition for the accessory region upon DNA binding. Furthermore, these results indicate that the accessory region lies close to the fingers in the protein-DNA complex. This region thus does not extend along the DNA away from the zinc fingers; it more likely binds the same stretch of DNA contacted by the zinc fingers. Comparison to the behavior of other zinc-finger proteins that utilize an accessory DNA-binding sequence suggested that the region of ADR1 proximal to the zinc fingers might form an alpha-helix. Analysis of sequential NOEs in the accessory region of DNA-bound ADR1z reveals no helical structure.",2020-05-01T00:58:48.086704,pubmed,2,34359520,879811200,Paramagnetic Cobalt as a Probe of the Orientation of an Accessory Dna-Binding Region of the Yeast Adr1 Zinc-Finger Protein,14003-11,46,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0006-2960,biochemistry,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,1588294728,36,1,M Schmiedeskamp,2,R E Klevit,1997-11-18T00:00:00,1588294728,paramagnetic-cobalt-as-a-probe-of-the-orientation-of-an-accessory-dna-binding-region-of-the-yeast-adr1-zinc-finger-protein,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/bi971364f,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9369471,2020-05-01T00:58:48.086704,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,,,,academic,Americas,US,United States,Uw,University of Washington Seattle Campus,,university-of-washington,University of Washington,231,1.556,academic,Americas,US,United States,Uw,University of Washington Seattle Campus,,university-of-washington,University of Washington,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R M Touyz,S Rathakrishnan,"Epidemiological evidence shows a positive relationship between alcohol consumption and blood pressure. High alcohol intake and hypertension are common in urban South African men. Relationships between mean arterial pressure (MAP), serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) as an index of alcohol intake, age, mass and levels of cations in the serum and erythrocytes were investigated in normotensive and hypertensive black and coloured men. Serum levels of potassium, magnesium and calcium and the red blood cell magnesium level were found to be significantly decreased in the black hypertensives. Serum GGT was equally raised in normotensive and hypertensive blacks and was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure in the hypertensive subjects. The coloured hypertensives were heavier, older and had significantly higher serum GGT levels than their normotensive counterparts. Serum GGT was positively correlated with MAP in the coloured subjects. No consistent relationships were found between GGT and blood cations. These data suggest that in younger black subjects alcohol is associated with systolic blood pressure only once hypertension has developed. Other factors, such as cations, may be more important than alcohol in the pathogenesis of hypertension in this group.

Christian Walter Albert Schyma,,"Gelatine is a reliable tissue simulant in wound ballistic experiments. The projectile penetrating the gelatine transfers energy and causes radial cracks according to the temporary cavity. Thus the crack length is a function of the energy spent in the medium. In practice the fissures are poorly contrasted for which reason an enhancement of contrast was searched. A series of six shoots with expanding bullets (9 mm x 19 Action-5, 9 mm x 19 Quick Defense 1, 5.56 mm x 45 Styx Action) was realized on 10% gelatine blocks at 4 degrees C temperature. Three blocks were marked with acryl paint on the front, three blocks were shot native. The blocks were cut in slices of 1cm thickness and optically scanned. The evaluation was performed according to Fackler's wound profile, the total crack length method and the polygon method. The paint was soaked into the block by the collapse of the temporary cavity and transported with diminishing intensity to the end of the trajectory. Colour contrast was successfully realized in all the shots which made easier to measure the length of the fissures. The comparison of the shots with and without paint gave a better reproducibility of measures with colour contrast. Using paint the energy transfer began earlier so that the curve of the wound profile was shifted by 1cm to the entry which is explicated by the paint pad put on the block. The maximum crack lengths did not significantly differ with and without paint. All evaluation methods profited from colour contrast but the total crack length method the most of all. Further experiments showed that colour contrast is also successful in 20% gelatine and is not dependent of the type of projectile.",2020-05-02T02:20:06.819772,pubmed,1,44889468,1271289600,Colour Contrast in Ballistic Gelatine,114-8,1-3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0379-0738,forensic-science-international,Forensic Sci.

A Beech,G C Baylis,"Three experiments are reported using the 'negative priming' paradigm to investigate cognitive differences in normal schizotypal subjects. Lists of Stroop colour words were presented at different display times in a number of priming and non-priming conditions, in one of which the ignored colour name predicted the colour of the next target item. The increased RT latencies to the target normally found in this condition were reduced, or even reversed, in high schizotypal subjects selected on the basis of a new schizotypy scale (STA). This effect was confined to a very short presentation time (100 ms), suggesting that schizotypy is associated with weakened inhibition operating in the early (automatic) stages of information processing.

NIST SRM 909 Human Serum containing 91.3 micrograms/L chromium was used as the Cr Standard. To obtain reliable values for cobalt and molybdenum, three different independent analytical methods were employed to analyze each sample: 1) dilution of the samples with Triton TX-100 solution, followed by GFAAS; 2) microwave decomposition of the samples, followed by GFAAS; 3) classic nitric-perchloric acid decomposition of the samples, followed by GFAAS. The two decomposition methods were used to control the accuracy of the dilution method. The results showed that the non-decomposition method gave comparable results to the decomposition techniques for analysis of synovial fluid and blood.

E Smolders,,"Food chain contamination by cadmium (Cd) is the most important pathway of Cd exposure to the general population, excluding smokers. Factors affecting transfer of Cd from soil and air to plants are reviewed. The direct deposition of airborne Cd in the plants has only a marginal influence on the crop Cd concentrations in rural areas with low atmospheric Cd deposition, i.e. < 2 g Cd ha(-1) y(-1). However, the indirect evidence is presented, predicting that airborne Cd may be the major source of crop Cd and dietary Cd in conditions where atmospheric Cd deposition is well above 10 g Cd ha(-1) y(-1). This situation may occur around pyrometallurgic smelters with high Cd emissions. The absorption of Cd by plant roots is more influenced by soil factors, controlling Cd bioavailability than by total soil Cd. Elevated soil-plant Cd transfer is observed in soils with chloride salinity, in zinc deficient soils and acid soils.",2020-05-01T06:38:38.924876,pubmed,1,36793760,978307200,Cadmium Uptake by Plants,177-83,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1232-1087,international-journal-of-occupational-medicine-and-environmental-health,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International Journal of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health,1588315118,14,1,E Smolders,,,2001-01-01T00:00:00,1588315118,cadmium-uptake-by-plants,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11548068,,,,,2020-05-01T06:38:38.924876,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,0.447,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R Kornu,W J Maloney,"In total joint arthroplasty, long-term outcomes depend in part on the biocompatibility of implant alloys. This study analyzed effects of surface finish and diamond-like carbon coating on osteoblast cell adhesion to polished titanium-aluminum-vanadium and polished or grit-blasted cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys. Osteoblast binding was tested in the presence and absence of the cell adhesion proteins fibronectin, laminin, fibrinogen, and vitronectin and was quantified by measurement of DNA content. Although adherence occurred in serum-free medium, maximal osteoblast binding required serum and was similar for titanium and cobalt alloys at 2 and 12 hours. With the grit-blasted cobalt alloy, cell binding was reduced 48% (p < 0.05) by 24 hours. Coating the alloys with diamond-like carbon did not alter osteoblast adhesion, whereas fibronectin pretreatment increased cell binding 2.6-fold (p < 0.05). In contrast, fibrinogen, vitronectin, and laminin did not enhance cell adhesion. These results support the hypothesis that cell adhesion proteins can modify cell binding to orthopaedic alloys. Although osteoblast binding was not affected by the presence of diamond-like carbon, this coating substance may influence other longer term processes, such as bone formation, and deserves further study.",2020-05-01T00:17:52.375757,pubmed,4,34063055,846806400,Osteoblast Adhesion to Orthopaedic Implant Alloys: Effects of Cell Adhesion Molecules and Diamond-Like Carbon Coating,871-7,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0736-0266,journal-of-orthopaedic-research-official-publication-of-the-orthopaedic-research-society,J.

T E Fitzpatrick,C H Graham,"Low levels of oxygen characterize certain biological settings such as the first trimester human placenta and rapidly growing tumors. Hypoxia in tumors and expression of high levels of tumor-associated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) indicate a poor prognosis for some cancer patients. Furthermore, PAI-1 may promote tumor invasion and metastasis by modulating cell adhesion and detachment from the extracellular matrix. In this study, we used immortalized human trophoblasts (HTR-8/SVneo cells) derived from first trimester placenta to study the effect of exposure to low levels of oxygen on PAI-1 expression. Cell viability following 24-h exposure to 1% oxygen was similar to that of cells cultured under 20% oxygen. Exposure to hypoxia resulted in time-dependent increases in PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels, as determined by Northern blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Culture with cobalt chloride or Tiron also resulted in increased PAI-1 mRNA levels, while carbon monoxide inhibited the hypoxia-mediated increase, thereby indicating that a heme protein is involved in the stimulation of PAI-1 expression by hypoxia. Incubation with transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) also resulted in increased levels of PAI-1 mRNA. However, addition of a neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibody to hypoxic cultures did not abrogate the increase in PAI-1 mRNA levels, suggesting that hypoxia stimulates PAI-1 expression via a pathway that does not require TGF-beta production. These results indicate that, through their effect on PAI-1 expression, oxygen levels may play an important role in modulating cellular migration and invasion.",2020-05-01T02:33:11.704865,pubmed,2,35033606,911952000,Stimulation of Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 Expression in Immortalized Human Trophoblast Cells Cultured under Low Levels of Oxygen,155-62,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0014-4827,experimental-cell-research,Exp.

C Ernst,H J Rehm,"A bacterium utilizing 2-chloro-4,6-diamino-s-triazine (CAAT) as sole nitrogen source was isolated under a N2-free atmosphere and identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae. Concomitant to CAAT degradation the protein content increased and chloride was released into the medium. Under air and a N2-atmosphere no reduction of CAAT degradation resulted, though this strain is able to fix molecular nitrogen, but the decomposition accelerated under anaerobic conditions. The degradation rate increased continuously with increasing CAAT concentration. A continuous CAAT degradation without CAAT accumulation was possible up to a influx rate of 4.8 mumol.l-1h-1 (dilution rate = 0.007 h-1). K. pneumoniae A2 was also able to utilize deethylsimazine (CEAT) and deethylatrazine (CIAT) as nitrogen source. Both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions CEAT could be degraded faster than CIAT. The degradation sequence of mixed s-triazines was cyanuric acid < CAAT < CEAT < CIAT, which was reflected by the degradation times of single compounds.

P Abbott,S Y S Heah,"Bleaching endodontically treated teeth was very predictable, especially for grey or light yellow discolourations. Glass ionomer cement/composite restorations were effective at preventing further discolouration.

The most common teeth were upper central (69 per cent) and lateral (20.4 per cent) incisors. Trauma was the most common cause (58.8 per cent), followed by previous dental treatment (23.9 per cent), pulp necrosis (13.7 per cent) and pulp canal calcification (3.6 per cent). Dark yellow and black teeth required more applications of bleach than light yellow and grey teeth. Colour modification was ""good"" (87.1 per cent) or ""acceptable"" (12.9 per cent).

P R Hoskins,J Prattis,"It has recently been observed using power Doppler that cerebral aneurysms appear to change size through the cardiac cycle. The purpose of this study was to develop a pulsatile flow model of cerebral aneurysm expansion and to investigate whether the observations of pulsation could be confirmed using the model. The model consisted of a latex bubble glued onto the side of a latex tube. A computer controlled pump was used to generate pulsatile flow. The degree of bubble expansion was adjusted by the use of flow restrictor placed in the downstream section of the flow rig. Ultrasound images were acquired using an Acuson 128 XP/10V colour flow scanner. True expansion (maximum area/minimum area) was measured from the B-scan image using a 7 MHz probe. Three observers measured expansion of the simulated aneurysm from the power Doppler images using a 2 MHz probe. Expansion measured with the power Doppler decreased as the colour gain setting increased, and decreased as the persistence increased. The true expansion of 1.43 was comparable with the colour gain set optimally for a persistence value of 3. The model allows simple investigations of the relationship between true aneurysm expansion and that measured from the power Doppler images. Colour gain and persistence settings must be standardized in clinical studies.",2020-05-01T02:30:27.943470,pubmed,3,35013186,883612800,A Flow Model of Cerebral Aneurysms for Use with Power Doppler Studies,76-80,841,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0007-1285,the-british-journal-of-radiology,Br J Radiol,The British Journal of Radiology,1588300227,71,1,P R Hoskins,2,J Prattis,1998-01-01T00:00:00,1588300227,a-flow-model-of-cerebral-aneurysms-for-use-with-power-doppler-studies,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1259/bjr.71.841.9534703,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9534703,2020-05-01T02:30:27.943470,,,,,,,,,J Wardlaw,,,,,,,,,,,,96,0.728,,,,,,,,,,3,J Wardlaw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all three cases of endoleak the colour Doppler diagnosis was supported by CT scan and confirmed on angiography. The CT scans did not provide any additional information to that obtained by colour Doppler imaging. patients were followed over a period of 53 months (median follow-up time 15 months) with 106 colour Doppler scans of 39 endovascular grafts (mean of 2.9 scans per patient). patients underwent attempted insertion of an EVT (endovascular prosthesis) for exclusion of abdominal aortic aneurysm (mean diameter 5.3 cm; range 4.0 to 8.4 cm).

D A Basketter,G Briatico-Vangosa,"In spite of the improved awareness of the potential for nickel, cobalt and chromium to cause skin allergy, the incidence of sensitization to them is generally on the increase, especially for nickel. We review data from the literature and industry on transition metal contamination of consumer products and assess the hazard to man. Consumer products are defined as personal care items and detergent/cleaning products used regularly in domestic work. The analytical data demonstrate that consumer products are a relatively minor source of contact with nickel, cobalt or chromium. The traces found in consumer products will not be the primary cause of sensitization to these metals: levels will be too low and exposure too brief. A person sensitized to these metals has many other more significant sources of daily contact such as earrings, jewelry and metal objects. It is therefore necessary to focus on decreasing the high exposure to these transition metals from other sources rather than on possible trace amounts found in consumer products. Current good manufacturing practice ensures that trace nickel, cobalt and chromium concentrations in consumer products are less than 5 ppm of each metal. It is recommended that this be accepted as a standard for maximum concentrations and that the target should be to achieve concentrations as low as 1 ppm.",2020-05-01T00:25:33.208367,pubmed,5,34120038,725846400,"Nickel, Cobalt and Chromium in Consumer Products: a Role in Allergic Contact Dermatitis",15-25,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0105-1873,contact-dermatitis,Contact Derm.,Contact Dermatitis,1588292733,28,1,D A Basketter,2,G Briatico-Vangosa,1993-01-01T00:00:00,1588292733,nickel-cobalt-and-chromium-in-consumer-products-a-role-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1111/j.1600-0536.1993.tb03318.x,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8428439,2020-05-01T00:25:33.208367,review,review,,,review,review,,,W Kaestner,C Lally,W J Bontinck,,,,,,,,,,88,0.524,,,,,,,,,,3,W Kaestner,4,C Lally,,,,,5,,W J Bontinck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In two patients recurrent pseudoaneurysms developed after cardiac surgery, three had acute rupture after myocardial infarction, two were the result of stab wounds, one was a late rupture of a true left ventricular aneurysm, one developed after surgical resection of a true left ventricular aneurysm, and two as a consequence of left ventricular venting. In all 11 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by angiographic or surgical information or both. The diagnosis was suspected clinically in only four cases. Cross sectional echocardiography alone confirmed the diagnosis in five cases. Neither pulsed wave Doppler nor continuous wave Doppler established the diagnosis when they were used without colour flow imaging in five and three cases respectively. In all 11 cases colour flow imaging showed flow in and out of the pericardial cavity at the defect site as well as the abnormal flow within the pseudoaneurysm. Subsequent use of pulsed Doppler showed a consistent ""to and fro"" flow pattern across the myocardial defect with characteristic respiratory variation of the peak systolic velocity. This unique intrapericardial flow pattern is diagnostic of a pseudoaneurysm.

Derek H Arnold,Colin W G Clifford,"When a stimulus oscillates in both colour and direction of motion, changes in colour must lag behind those in direction if they are to be seen as concurrent. It has been argued that this lag is the consequence of asynchronous visual processing, with colour being processed more rapidly than motion. This proposal is contentious: it has been criticized on the basis that the time-course of cortical activity may not correlate directly with that of perceptual experience. Here, we demonstrate that the extent of the apparent asynchrony can vary according to the prevailing stimulus conditions. The apparent asynchrony is greatest if the stimulus is composed of opponent directions of motion and is reduced if the angular difference between the directions is reduced. This pattern of results suggests that asynchronous neural activity arises, in part, as a consequence of differential levels of inhibition within relatively independent cortical structures.",2020-05-01T06:30:51.534092,pubmed,2,36735991,1016755200,Determinants of Asynchronous Processing in Vision,579-83,1491,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,proceedings-biological-sciences,Proc.

Positive and negative relationship paintings differ in the character of activity described. The sun as an element in children's paintings is painted not more frequent on positive compared to negative pictures. The colour black is used more often in the drawings signifying negative relationships. While girls used more colour in negative relationship drawings, boys used more colour in the positive ones. There was no significant difference in the use of favourite colours and decorative elements between the two groups. Only in negative relationship drawings people were looking away from each other. Smiling individuals were more common in the positive relationship pictures and in pictures painted by the 6 to 8 year olds. A greater distance between the individuals emerged on negative relationship drawings of the girls.",2020-05-01T17:10:43.022183,pubmed,1,41081458,1104537600,How Children show Positive and Negative Relationships on their Drawings,3-18,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0032-7034,praxis-der-kinderpsychologie-und-kinderpsychiatrie,Prax Kinderpsychol Kinderpsychiatr,Praxis Der Kinderpsychologie Und Kinderpsychiatrie,1588353043,54,1,Sabine Gramel,,,2005-01-01T00:00:00,1588353043,how-children-show-positive-and-negative-relationships-on-their-drawings,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15730148,,,,,2020-05-01T17:10:43.022183,english-abstract,english abstract,,,english-abstract,english abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,18,0.169,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R P Kusy,L Mims,"The mechanical characteristics of 24 of the 36 wire cross-sectional configurations were investigated in the as-received state from among the 4 tempers of a cobalt-chromium product. After engineering mechanics were used to validate the efficacy of the span combinations, each wire was measured in flexure to determine its elastic modulus and in tension to determine its yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and ductility. Other combined characteristics were evaluated, including flexibility, resilience, and the yield strength criterion. In these as-received materials the formability sometimes followed expectations, but the flexibility and resilience characteristics were variable and independent of temper. And although the elastic modulus was independent of testing parameters, it was affected by the loss of material at the corners of rectangular wires. Overall, the stiffnesses of cobalt-chromium wires in round configurations were comparable to those of multi- and single-stranded stainless steel wires but were 3 and 6 times greater than the stiffnesses of beta-titanium and nickel-titanium wires, respectively. In the final analysis, these as-received wires do not meet their potential as a variably formable and variably resilient alternative to stainless steel. Perhaps this is why cobalt-chromium wires have never had the impact on the profession that was expected from them several years ago.",2020-05-01T06:11:01.480381,pubmed,3,36596286,983404800,Mechanical Characteristics of various Tempers of As-Received Cobalt-Chromium Archwires,274-91,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0889-5406,american-journal-of-orthodontics-and-dentofacial-orthopedics-official-publication-of-the-american-association-of-orthodontists-its-constituent-societies-and-the-american-board-of-orthodontics,Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop,"American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics : Official Publication of the American Association of Orthodontists, its Constituent Societies, and the American Board of Orthodontics",1588313461,119,1,R P Kusy,2,L Mims,2001-03-01T00:00:00,1588313461,mechanical-characteristics-of-various-tempers-of-as-received-cobalt-chromium-archwires,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1067/mod.2001.111554,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11244422,2020-05-01T06:11:01.480381,,,,,,,,,J Q Whitley,,,,,,,,,,,,105,1.154,,,,,,,,,,3,J Q Whitley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pii,,S0889-5406(01)44885-2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, kitchen waste, paper, textile, etc. were chosen to simulate the MSW. The effects of temperature, air staging, and moisture on the CO formation and emissions were analysed for both the grate drying bed combustion and the CFB combustion. In the grate drying bed, the low temperatures increased the carbon to CO conversion rate which also increased slightly with the moisture content. Industrial field tests in a commercial grate-CFB incinerator showed that the CO concentration at the grate drying bed exit was very high and decreased along furnace height. The carbon to CO conversion rates were 0-20% for the grate drying bed which exceeded the range of 0.8-16% measured in a grate drying bed exit of the commercial grate-CFB incinerator tests. In the commercial grate-CFB incinerator tests, at excess air ratios ranging from 1.5-2.0 or more, the CO emissions decreased to a low and stable level, whose corresponding carbon to CO conversion rates were far lower than 0-10%.

Joacim Rocklöv,Bertil Forsberg,"The short-term effects of high temperatures are a serious concern in the context of climate change. In areas that today have mild climates the research activity has been rather limited, despite the fact that differences in temperature susceptibility will play a fundamental role in understanding the exposure, acclimatization, adaptation and health risks of a changing climate. In addition, many studies employ biometeorological indexes without careful investigation of the regional heterogeneity in the impact of relative humidity. We aimed to investigate the effects of summer temperature and relative humidity and regional differences in three regions of Sweden allowing for heterogeneity of the effect over the scale of summer temperature. To do so, we collected mortality data for ages 65+ from Stockholm, Göteborg and Skåne from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute for the years 1998 through 2005. In Stockholm and Skåne on average 22 deaths per day occurred, while in Göteborg the mean frequency of daily deaths was 10. We fitted time-series regression models to estimate relative risks of high ambient temperatures on daily mortality using smooth functions to control for confounders, and estimated non-linear effects of exposure while allowing for auto-regressive correlation of observations within summers. The effect of temperature on mortality was found distributed over the same or following day, with statistically significant cumulative combined relative risk of about 5.1% (CI = 0.3, 10.1) per degrees C above the 90th percentile of summer temperature. The effect of high relative humidity was statistically significant in only one of the regions, as was the effect of relative humidity (above 80th percentile) and temperature (above 90th percentile). In the southernmost region studied there appeared to be a significant increase in mortality with decreasing low summer temperatures that was not apparent in the two more northerly situated regions. The effects of warm temperatures on the elderly population in Sweden are rather strong and consistent across different regions after adjustment for mortality displacement. The impact of relative humidity appears to be different in regions, and may be a more important predictor of mortality in some areas.",2020-05-02T02:31:06.125376,pubmed,2,44994254,1275350400,The Effect of High Ambient Temperature on the Elderly Population in three Regions of Sweden,2607-19,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1660-4601,international-journal-of-environmental-research-and-public-health,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,1588386666,7,1,Joacim Rocklöv,2,Bertil Forsberg,2010-06-01T00:00:00,1588386666,the-effect-of-high-ambient-temperature-on-the-elderly-population-in-three-regions-of-sweden,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20644691,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC2905568,2020-05-02T02:31:06.125376,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,78,0.818,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,3637014,Joacim Rocklöv,joacim-rocklov,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.3390/ijerph7062607,,,TRUE,3637014,Joacim Rocklöv,joacim-rocklov,joacim-rocklov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,public health,climate change,heat waves,temperature,mortality,humidity,public-health,public health,climate-change,climate change,heat-waves,heat waves,temperature,temperature,mortality,mortality,humidity,humidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,death,heat,weather,death,death,heat,heat,weather,weather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Mansoor Ahmad,Xiangmin Zhao,"Endothelium-denuded bovine pulmonary arteries (BPA) contract to hypoxia through a mechanism potentially involving removing a superoxide-derived hydrogen peroxide-mediated relaxation. BPA organ cultured for 24 h with 0.1 mM cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)) to increase the expression and activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is accompanied by a decrease in 5 microM lucigenin-detectable superoxide and an increase in horseradish peroxidase-luminol detectable peroxide levels. Force development to KCl in BPA was not affected by increases in HO-1, but the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) response was decreased. Organ culture with a HO-1 inhibitor (10 microM chromium mesoporphyrin) reversed the effects of HO-1 on HPV and peroxide. Treatment of HO-1-induced BPA with extracellular catalase resulted in reversal of the attenuation of HPV without affecting the force development to KCl. Increasing intracellular peroxide scavenging with 0.1 mM ebselen increased force development to KCl and partially reversed the decrease in HPV seen on induction of HO-1. HO-1 induction increases extracellular (ec) superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression without changing Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD levels. HO-1-induced BPA rings treated with the copper chelator 10 mM diethyldithiocarbamate to inactivate ecSOD and Cu,Zn-SOD showed increased superoxide and decreased peroxide to levels equal to non-HO-1-induced rings, whereas the addition of SOD to freshly isolated BPA rings attenuated HPV similar to HO-1 induction with CoCl(2). Therefore, HO-1 induction in BPA increases ecSOD expression associated with enhanced generation of peroxide in amounts that may not be adequately removed during hypoxia, leading to an attenuation of HPV.",2020-05-02T02:24:48.491602,pubmed,7,44932036,1254355200,Heme Oxygenase-1 Induction Modulates Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction through Upregulation of Ecsod,H1453-61,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0363-6135,american-journal-of-physiology-heart-and-circulatory-physiology,Am.

J A Warner,J M Frederick,"The use of a mechanical ventilation system in suitable homes resulted in some reduction in numbers of HDM and Der p 1 concentrations. The addition of an HEVC slightly enhanced the effect but not sufficiently to see an improvement in symptoms. Homes with mechanical ventilation achieved significantly lower humidity levels than those without (P <.001), with an associated reduction of mite numbers (P <.05) and Der p 1 concentrations (P <.001 ¿in nanograms per gram, P =.006 ¿in milligrams per square meter) in bedroom carpets and some other mite sources in the ventilated areas of the homes. The addition of a vacuum cleaner enhanced this effect. There was a trend for an improvement in histamine PC(20) (P =.085) in the patients whose homes were ventilated. The homes of 40 HDM-sensitive asthmatic subjects were randomized to receive (1) mechanical ventilation and a high-efficiency vacuum cleaner (HEVC); (2) mechanical ventilation alone; (3) an HEVC alone; and (4) no intervention. Homes and patients were monitored for 12 months. Change in absolute humidity, mite numbers, Der p 1 concentrations, lung function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and symptom scores were analyzed. We sought to investigate the effect of mechanical ventilation and high-efficiency vacuuming on HDM numbers and Der p 1 concentrations in the homes of mite-sensitive asthmatic subjects and to evaluate the effect of any reductions on symptoms. The relationship between exposure to house dust mite (HDM) allergens and prevalence of sensitization to these allergens in patients with asthma has been confirmed in many studies. Mite population growth is regulated by humidity. Reducing humidity and removing allergen by efficient vacuuming should control mite allergen and reduce symptoms.",2020-05-01T05:46:58.153380,pubmed,9,36440410,946684800,Mechanical Ventilation and High-Efficiency Vacuum Cleaning: a Combined Strategy of Mite and Mite Allergen Reduction in the Control of Mite-Sensitive Asthma,75-82,1 Pt 1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1097-6825,the-journal-of-allergy-and-clinical-immunology,J.

R P Gallemore,R H Steinberg,"While using cobalt (Co2+) to block synaptic transmission in an in vitro preparation of chick retina, the authors observed significant changes in the DC electroretinogram (DC ERG). Cobalt (3.0 mM) increased the amplitudes of all three photoreceptor-dependent responses of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE): the c-wave, fast-oscillation trough, and light peak. Intracellular recordings from RPE cells revealed that Co2+ increased those light-evoked changes in RPE membrane potentials that contribute to each of these responses. Monitoring of subretinal [K+]o with K(+)-selective microelectrodes showed that Co2+ increased the amplitude of the light-evoked [K+]o decrease, and this must contribute to the observed increase in c-wave and fast-oscillation trough because both are generated by this [K+]o change. Cobalt also increased the initial rate of [K+]o decrease at light-onset, the rate of subretinal [K+]o reaccumulation during maintained illumination, and the amplitude of the [K+]o overshoot at light-offset. The Co(2+)-induced increases in light-evoked RPE responses and subretinal [K+]o changes may arise from a direct effect on photoreceptors because (1) blockade of postphotoreceptoral activity did not block these effects of Co2+; and (2) Co2+ did not alter significantly the electrical properties of isolated RPE-choroid tissues. The authors conclude that, in the cone-dominated chick retina, Co2+ may act directly on the photoreceptors to increase the light response.",2020-04-30T18:23:06.345376,pubmed,2,27624279,688953600,Cobalt Increases Photoreceptor-Dependent Responses of the Chick Retinal Pigment Epithelium,3041-52,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0146-0404,investigative-ophthalmology-visual-science,Invest.

A Fiorentini,,"Visual objects that differ from the surroundings for some simple feature, e.g. colour or line orientation, or for some shape parameters (""textons"", Julez, 1986) are believed to be detected in parallel from different locations in the visual field without requiring a serial search process. Tachistoscopic presentations of textures were used to compare the time course of search processes in the fovea and parafovea. Detection of targets differing for a simple feature (line orientation or line crossings) from the surrounding elements was found to have a time course typical of parallel processing for coarse textures extending into the parafovea. For fine textures confined into the fovea the time course was suggestive of a serial search process even for these textons. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that parallel processing of lines or crossings is subserved by a coarse network of detectors with relatively large receptive field and low resolution. For the counting of coloured spots in a background of a different colour the parafovea has the same time requirements as the fovea.",2020-04-30T18:37:44.584355,pubmed,1,28046240,599616000,Differences between Fovea and Parafovea in Visual Search Processes,1153-64,9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0042-6989,vision-research,Vision Res.,Vision Research,1588271864,29,1,A Fiorentini,,,1989-01-01T00:00:00,1588271864,differences-between-fovea-and-parafovea-in-visual-search-processes,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2617862,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/0042-6989(89)90062-x,2020-04-30T18:37:44.584355,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,149,1.314,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

M Weinrich,T Vissiennon,"In organic waste, numerous mold fungi and other microorganisms develop sometimes within a few hours only which decompose the organic material already in the collecting containers generating heat and odor. With regard to the emission of mold fungus spores out of garbage cans for bio-waste and the potential environmental-hygienic danger connected with it, considerable worries have been expressed recently. A wide spectrum of mold fungi can be found in bio-waste in strongly varying concentrations. No noticeable difference could be ascertained between the settlement structure areas and the cities respectively as to the fungus concentration in the bio-waste substrate. A. fumigatus and A. niger can be recommended as leading spores for the behavior of the total concentration of fungi in the bio-waste due to their frequency of detection and their seasonal dynamism. The intensity of the air spore pollution through emission of mold fungus spores correlates closely with the climatic conditions, such as variations of temperature, relative humidity and solar radiation. The airborne release of mold fungus spores out of garbage cans for bio-waste and the formation of a respective exposure connected with it is judged as harmless for healthy persons. Risk patients and persons having a weakened immune system or assumed to have such a one due to an existent basic illness and/or other reasons should avoid any handling of bio-waste as well as any other waste if possible.",2020-05-01T03:33:39.320099,pubmed,5,35508951,944006400,Nature and Frequency of the Existence of Mold Fungi in Garbage Cans for Biological Waste and the Resultant Airborne Spore Pollution,454-8,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0005-9366,berliner-und-munchener-tierarztliche-wochenschrift,Berl.

Russell A Hill,,"The importance of thermoregulation as a constraint on behavior has received comparatively little attention in relation to other ecological factors. Despite this, a number of studies suggested that high temperature may represent an important ecological constraint. This paper examines the impact of temperature on activity scheduling in a troop of chacma baboons (Papio hamadryas ursinus) at De Hoop Nature Reserve, South Africa. Once the daily, seasonal, and individual effects were controlled for, the ""perceived environmental temperature"" (PET), which accounts for the relative contributions of solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity on shade temperature, was a significant constraint on behavior. With high PET, feeding declines, and there is an increase in grooming and particularly resting behavior. Baboons thus engage in more sedentary behaviors as temperature increases, with significantly higher levels of resting and grooming when temperature exceeds the approximate thermal neutral zone for baboons. Seeking shade is an important behavioral response to thermal stress, and PET was a significant determinant of whether an animal was in shade while engaged in either resting or grooming behavior. Furthermore, the proportion of time spent in shade increased across air temperatures that were below, within, and above the thermal neutral zone for baboons. Finally, since resting and grooming are conducted preferentially in certain habitat types, thermoregulatory considerations also impact on patterns of habitat choice and day-journey routes. This suggests that the thermal environment is an ecological variable that should be given greater consideration in future studies of primate behavior.",2020-05-01T17:11:50.021426,pubmed,1,41110329,1138752000,Thermal Constraints on Activity Scheduling and Habitat Choice in Baboons,242-9,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0002-9483,american-journal-of-physical-anthropology,Am.

M S Lin,Y C Wu,"A cobalt(II)hexacyanoferrate-based biosensor has been prepared simply by codeposition of an enzyme, together with the electrochemical formation of a cobalt (II)hexacyanoferrate compound electrochemically. The compound can be generated at a constant potential of -0.05 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). This compound possesses the catalytic property of reducing hydrogen peroxide to water at the operating potential of 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The mixed-valence compound-based biosensor possesses an unique interference-independent feature, which is important for biomedical application; this feature is attributed to the low overvoltage characteristic of cobalt (II)hexacyanoferrate. The electrochemical glucose biosensor responds to a series of glucose injections with linearity up to 5 mM (with correlation coefficient R = 0.9999) and the sensitivity of the linear portion is 733 nA/(cm2 x mM). The detection limit is 2 x 10(-6)M (S/N = 3). Both the potential-dependent electron transfer rate constant and the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant were studied in rotating disk experiments. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, Km' calculated from the slope of the ""Lineweaver-Burke"" type reciprocal plot is 28 mM. A fast-response characteristic is observed in the rotating disk experiment and the 95% response time is 14.5 sec.

Cibele V Rudge,Halina B Röllin,"Environmental toxicants such as metals may be detrimental to foetus and infant development and health because of their physiological immaturity, opportunistic and differential exposures, and a longer lifetime over which disease, initiated during pregnancy and in early life, can develop. The placental mechanisms responsible for regulation of absorption and excretion of elements during pregnancy are not fully understood. The aim of this paper is to assess the correlation for selected toxic and essential elements in paired whole blood samples of delivering women and cord blood, as well as to evaluate the placental permeability for selected elements. Regression analyses used to assess this correlation in 62-paired samples of maternal and cord whole blood of delivering women show that the concentrations of mercury, lead, cobalt, arsenic and selenium in maternal and cord blood differed statistically. Lead, cobalt, arsenic and selenium appear to pass the placental barrier by a diffusion mechanism. It was also found that the mercury levels in cord blood were almost double those of the mother, suggesting that the foetus may act as a filter for the maternal mercury levels during pregnancy. Transplacental transfer for arsenic and cobalt was 80% and 45%, respectively, suggesting that the placenta modulates the rate of transfer for these elements. Cadmium, manganese, copper and zinc levels did not show statistically significant correlations between two compartments (maternal versus cord whole blood). The study confirms that most of the toxic metals measured have an ability to cross the placental barrier.",2020-05-02T02:07:29.829711,pubmed,6,44779274,1246406400,The Placenta as a Barrier for Toxic and Essential Elements in Paired Maternal and Cord Blood Samples of South African Delivering Women,1322-30,7,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1464-0325,journal-of-environmental-monitoring-jem,J Environ Monit,Journal of Environmental Monitoring : Jem,1588385249,11,1,Cibele V Rudge,2,Halina B Röllin,2009-07-01T00:00:00,1588385249,the-placenta-as-a-barrier-for-toxic-and-essential-elements-in-paired-maternal-and-cord-blood-samples-of-south-african-delivering-women,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20449220,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1039/b903805a,2020-05-02T02:07:29.829711,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Claudina M Nogueira,Yngvar Thomassen,Marilza C Rudge,academic,Americas,BR,Brazil,Sao Paulo State University Julio De Mesquita Filho,Universidade Estadual Paulista,Unesp,universidade-estadual-paulista-julio-de-mesquita-filho,Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio De Mesquita Filho,,,academic,Americas,BR,Brazil,Sao Paulo State University Julio De Mesquita Filho,Universidade Estadual Paulista,Unesp,universidade-estadual-paulista-julio-de-mesquita-filho,Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio De Mesquita Filho,3,Claudina M Nogueira,4,Yngvar Thomassen,,,,,5,,Marilza C Rudge,,,,,,,,,Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio De Mesquita Filho - Campus De Sao,Universidade Estadual Paulista Julio De Mesquita Filho - Campus De Sao,,,,,,Jon Ø Odland,,Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio De Mesquita Filho,Universidade Estadual Paulista Júlio De Mesquita Filho,6,Jon Ø Odland,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M Miyazaki,A Rikuta,"A study was conducted to investigate the influence of temperature and relative humidity (RH) on the bond strengths of several recently developed dentin bonding systems. Six environmental conditions, (A) 25+/-0.5 degrees C, 50+/-5% RH, (B) 25+/-0.5 degrees C, 80+/-5% RH, (C) 25+/-0.5 degrees C, 95+/-5 % RH, (D) 37+/-0.5 degrees C, 50 +/-5 % RH, (E) 37+/-0.5 degrees C, 80+/-5% RH, (F) 37+/-0.5 degrees C, 95+/-5 % RH were used. Bovine mandibular incisors were mounted in self-curing resin and the facial surfaces were ground on wet #600 SiC paper to expose the dentin. After the tooth surface had been treated according to each manufacturer's instructions, adhesives were applied, followed by condensation of resin composites into a mold placed on the dentin surface. Fifteen specimens per group were stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C for 24 h, and then shear-tested at a cross-head speed of 1.0 mm/min.

T J Jentsch,W Günther,"Chloride channels are probably found in every cell, from bacteria to mammals. Their physiological tasks range from cell volume regulation to stabilization of the membrane potential, signal transduction, transepithelial transport and acidification of intracellular organelles. These different functions require the presence of many distinct chloride channels, which are differentially expressed and regulated by various stimuli. These include various intracellular messengers (like calcium and cyclic AMP), pH, extracellular ligands and transmembrane voltage. Three major structural classes of chloride channels are known to date, but there may be others not yet identified. After an overview of the general functions of chloride channels, this review will focus on these cloned chloride channels: the CLC chloride channel family, which includes voltage-gated chloride channels, and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), which performs other functions in addition to being a chloride channel. Finally, a short section deals with GABA and glycine receptors. Diseases resulting from chloride channel defects will be specially emphasized, together with the somewhat limited information about how these proteins work at the molecular level.",2020-05-01T00:27:30.564190,pubmed,2,34134626,854755200,Chloride Channels: an Emerging Molecular Picture,117-26,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0265-9247,bioessays-news-and-reviews-in-molecular-cellular-and-developmental-biology,Bioessays,"Bioessays : News and Reviews in Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology",1588292850,19,1,T J Jentsch,2,W Günther,1997-02-01T00:00:00,1588292850,chloride-channels-an-emerging-molecular-picture,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1002/bies.950190206,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9046241,2020-05-01T00:27:30.564190,review,review,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,review,review,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,University of Hamburg,International Center for Graduate Studies,Universität Hamburg,universitat-hamburg,Universitat Hamburg,170,2.819,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,University of Hamburg,International Center for Graduate Studies,Universität Hamburg,universitat-hamburg,Universitat Hamburg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,University of Hamburg Faculty of Education Psychology and Physical Science,University of Hamburg Faculty of Education Psychology and Physical Science,,,,,,,,Universität Hamburg Fakultät Für Erziehungswissenschaft Psychologie Und Bewegungswissenschaft,Universität Hamburg Fakultät Für Erziehungswissenschaft Psychologie Und Bewegungswissenschaft,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
E Swarts,S J Miller,"A comprehensive failure analysis was performed on 6 femoral components and 1 tibial component that fractured in service. All were Whiteside Ortholoc II total knee arthroplasty components, manufactured from cast cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy and porous coated. Fracture surface analysis revealed fatigue-induced failure in all cases. Most fractures occurred at regions of high stress concentration, such as sharp corners, sintered beads, and thin sections. Metallurgical examination showed significant variation in grain size, interdendritic carbides, and hardness between samples. In some cases, continuous carbide networks and voids were prominent at the bead-substrate interface. Patient weight and surgical placement were identified as contributory factors in component failure. Limitations of cast cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy in weight-bearing applications must be emphasized, particularly when important determinants, such as design, metallurgy, and specific clinical factors, are less than optimal.",2020-05-01T06:47:09.134727,pubmed,5,36856330,1001894400,Fractured Whiteside Ortholoc Ii Knee Components,927-34,7,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-journal-of-arthroplasty,J Arthroplasty,The Journal of Arthroplasty,1588315629,16,1,E Swarts,2,S J Miller,2001-10-01T00:00:00,1588315629,fractured-whiteside-ortholoc-ii-knee-components,journal-article,journal article,,pii,,S0883-5403(01)64285-2,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11607912,2020-05-01T06:47:09.134727,case-reports,case reports,,,case-reports,case reports,,,C V Keogh,G Lim,R J Beaver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,C V Keogh,4,G Lim,,,,,5,,R J Beaver,,,,,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1054/arth.2001.25508,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
G Lahajnar,A Rupprecht,A sample of highly oriented Na-hyaluronate was prepared with a wet--spinning method and equilibrated to 75% relative humidity. Its proton NMR spectrum was recorded as a function of the angle theta between the hyaluronate helix axis and the external magnetic field. It appeared as a singlet with an angle-dependent line width expressed by delta v o + A(1-3cos2 theta)2. This reveals a residual intramolecular dipolar interaction of anisotropically rotating water molecules. The merging of the expected doublet into a single line is assumed to be caused by proton exchange between water molecules. The result indicates a hydration similar to that of many other fibrous biopolymers at comparable relative humidities.,2020-04-30T19:29:04.339132,pubmed,2,29588616,533347200,"Hydration of Sodium Hyaluronate, Nmr Study of an Oriented Sample",73-7,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0006-291X,biochemical-and-biophysical-research-communications,Biochem.

A Hedin,L Tallstedt,"The third edition of the Boström-Kugelberg pseudo-isochromatic plates was printed to the best possible visual match with the second edition. Slight colour differences between the 2 editions initiated this study where 72 colour defectives and 57 normal trichromats were tested with the plates and classified with the aid of Nagel's anomaloscope. Of the defectives, the plate test disclosed all but two anomalous trichromats. One normal subject was falsely classified as defective. The plates had to be shown twice according to the instructions since otherwise 13 of the 53 normals were misclassified. Three plates were shown to have low sensitivity; one is best used as a demonstration plate, and the other two can be deleted without lost efficiency. Forty-eight of the colour defectives were also studied with Farnsworth's lantern. The correlation between the numbers of plate and signal errors was weak. All subjects who failed the lantern test made several plate errors, but 15 subjects who passed the lantern test, made two or more errors on the plate test.

Marcel H Zandvoort,Eric D Van Hullebusch,"The effect of a sulfur source on the performance and metal retention of methanol-fed upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactors was investigated. For this purpose, two UASB reactors were operated with cobalt preloaded granular sludge (1 mM CoCl2; 30 degrees C; 24 h) at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 5 g COD.L reactor(-1).d(-1). One UASB reactor (R1) was operated without a sulfur source in the influent during the first 37 days. In this period the methanol conversion to methane remained very poor, apparently due to the absence of a sulfur source, because once cysteine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, was added to the influent of R1 (day 37) a full conversion of methanol to methane occurred within 6 days. The second reactor (R2) was operated with sulfate (0.41 mM) in the influent during the first 86 days of operation, during which no limitation in the methanol conversion to methane manifested. Cobalt washed out from the sludge at similar rates in both reactors. The leaching of cobalt occurred at two distinct rates, first at a high rate of 22 microg.g TSS(-1).d(-1), which proceeded mainly from the exchangeable and carbonate fraction and later at a relatively slow rate of 9 mug.g TSS(-1).d(-1) from the organic/sulfide fraction. This study showed that the supply of the sulfur source L-cysteine has a pronounced positive effect on the methanogenic activity and the retention of metals such as iron, zinc and molybdenum.",2020-05-01T17:15:48.726589,pubmed,5,41215584,,Effect of Sulfur Source on the Performance and Metal Retention of Methanol-Fed Uasb Reactors,839-50,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,8756-7938,biotechnology-progress,Biotechnol.

O H Siegmund,E Everman,"We present measurements of the quantum detectio efficiency (QDE) of potassium chloride, applied directly to the surface of a microchannel plate (MCP), over the 44-1460-A wavelength range. The contributions of the photocathode material in the channels, and on the interchannel web, to the QDE have been determined. Two broad peaks in the QDE centered at lambda congruent with 500 A and lambda congruent with 900 A are apparent, the former with ~40% peak QDE and the latter with ~30% peak QDE. The photoelectric threshold is observed at lambda ~1400 A, and there is a narrow QDE minimum at lambda~ 670 A, which correlates with 2xthe band gap energy for KC1.

W J Meuling,A C Franssen,"A large number of workers in agriculture are exposed daily (through skin contact) to pesticides either directly during mixing and loading or indirectly due to contact. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of skin moisture on the dermal uptake of the pesticide propoxur. The study was conducted in human volunteers under controlled temperature conditions (30 degrees C) and environmental relative humidities of either 50, 70 or 90%. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee. In this study a linear relationship between the environmental relative humidity and the level of skin moisture was observed. The results indicate that the level of skin moisture influences the absorption of propoxur via the dermal route, dramatically ranging from, on average, 13, 33-63% of the potentially absorbed dose' which is excreted in urine as the primary metabolite 2-isopropoxyphenol (IPP) at relative humidity levels of, on average 50, 70 and 90%, respectively. The 'potentially absorbed dose' is defined as the difference between the applied dose and the dislodged dose after 4 h.

This action of beta-amyloid 25-35 is not altered by pretreatment with the calcium channel blockers nifedipine or cobalt, with the depleter of intracellular calcium stores cyclopiazonic acid, or with the phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin. However, the effects of beta-amyloid 25-35 on cytosolic free calcium are absent in calcium-free buffer and are blocked by the antioxidant lazaroid U-83836E and by vitamin E. beta-Amyloid 25-35 is also neurotoxic and produces a concentration-dependent reduction in the viability of PC12 cells in culture. The neurotoxic action of beta-amyloid is blocked by U-83836E and vitamin E but not by nifedipine or cobalt.

L J Fleishman,M Persons,"Anoline lizards communicate with visual displays in which they open and close a colourful throat fan called the dewlap. We used a visual fixation reflex as an assay to test the effects of stimulus versus background chromatic and brightness contrast on the probability of detecting a moving coloured (i.e. dewlap-like) stimulus in Anolis cristatellus. The probability of stimulus detection depended on two additive visual-system channels, one responding to brightness contrast and one responding to chromatic contrast, independent of brightness. The brightness channel was influenced only by wavelengths longer than 450nm and probably received input only from middle- and/or long-wavelength photoreceptors. The chromatic contrast channel appeared to receive input from three, or possibly four, different classes of cone in the anoline retina, including one with peak sensitivity in the ultraviolet. We developed a multi-linear regression equation that described most of the results of this study to a reasonable degree of accuracy. In the future, this equation could be used to predict the relative visibility of different-coloured stimuli in different habitat light conditions, which should be very useful for testing hypotheses that attempt to relate habitat light conditions and visual-system response to the evolution of signal design.",2020-05-01T06:57:41.635478,pubmed,2,36935872,988675200,The Influence of Stimulus and Background Colour on Signal Visibility in the Lizard Anolis Cristatellus,1559-75,Pt 9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-0949,the-journal-of-experimental-biology,J.

Women exposed to electrical transmission installations showed elevated risks (OR 5.81, 95% CI 1.72 to 19.66). Positive associations with exposure to control rooms were seen among men and women, but most risk increases were restricted to subjects with dark iris colour. Application of published EMF measurements revealed stronger risk increases among women compared to men. Again, elevated risks were restricted to subjects with dark eye colour. Incident cases of uveal melanoma and population as well as hospital controls were included and frequency matched by country, 5-year birth cohort and sex. Subjects were asked whether they had worked close to high-voltage electrical transmission installations, computer screens and various electrical machines, or in complex electrical environments. Measurements of two Scandinavian job-exposure matrices were applied to estimate lifelong cumulative EMF exposure. Unconditional logistic regression analyses, stratified by sex and eye colour were calculated, adjusting for several potential confounders.

Brigitte Müller,Martin Glösmann,"Mammalian retinae have rod photoreceptors for night vision and cone photoreceptors for daylight and colour vision. For colour discrimination, most mammals possess two cone populations with two visual pigments (opsins) that have absorption maxima at short wavelengths (blue or ultraviolet light) and long wavelengths (green or red light). Microchiropteran bats, which use echolocation to navigate and forage in complete darkness, have long been considered to have pure rod retinae. Here we use opsin immunohistochemistry to show that two phyllostomid microbats, Glossophaga soricina and Carollia perspicillata, possess a significant population of cones and express two cone opsins, a shortwave-sensitive (S) opsin and a longwave-sensitive (L) opsin. A substantial population of cones expresses S opsin exclusively, whereas the other cones mostly coexpress L and S opsin. S opsin gene analysis suggests ultraviolet (UV, wavelengths <400 nm) sensitivity, and corneal electroretinogram recordings reveal an elevated sensitivity to UV light which is mediated by an S cone visual pigment. Therefore bats have retained the ancestral UV tuning of the S cone pigment. We conclude that bats have the prerequisite for daylight vision, dichromatic colour vision, and UV vision. For bats, the UV-sensitive cones may be advantageous for visual orientation at twilight, predator avoidance, and detection of UV-reflecting flowers for those that feed on nectar.",2020-05-02T02:30:34.773437,pubmed,6,44989112,1248739200,Bat Eyes have Ultraviolet-Sensitive Cone Photoreceptors,e6390,7,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1932-6203,plos-one,PLoS ONE,Plos one,1588386634,4,1,Brigitte Müller,2,Martin Glösmann,2009-07-28T00:00:00,1588386634,bat-eyes-have-ultraviolet-sensitive-cone-photoreceptors,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC2712075,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1371/journal.pone.0006390,2020-05-02T02:30:34.773437,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Leo Peichl,Gabriel C Knop,Cornelia Hagemann,,,,,,,,,,268,1.1,,,,,,,,,,3,Leo Peichl,4,Gabriel C Knop,,,,,5,,Cornelia Hagemann,TRUE,6562619,Leo Peichl,leo-peichl,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19636375,,,,,,,,Josef Ammermüller,,,,6,Josef Ammermüller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,1857176,Martin Glösmann,martin-glosmann,martin-glosmann,,,,,,,TRUE,1857176,Martin Glösmann,martin-glosmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,6562619,Leo Peichl,leo-peichl,leo-peichl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Gerd Heimlich,John A Cidlowski,"Apoptosis is a genetic program for the removal of unwanted cells from an organism, which is distinct from necrosis by its characteristic volume loss or apoptotic volume decrease. This cell shrinkage is the result of ion redistribution that is crucial for both the activation and execution of apoptosis. Here we report that UV-C but not Fas ligand treatment results in a significant decrease in intracellular chloride that can be abolished by modulation of chloride flux using either the chloride channel inhibitor SITS or medium with a reduced chloride concentration. Accordingly, downstream events are diminished during UV-C-induced apoptosis following chloride flux modulation, whereas Fas ligand-induced apoptotic characteristics are not affected. Moreover, the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway early in the apoptotic signaling cascade was affected by chloride flux in Jurkat T-cells. Thus, an alteration of intracellular chloride plays an important role in the activation of signaling molecules upstream of the mitochondria, specifically impairing the intrinsic but not extrinsic apoptotic pathway.",2020-05-01T17:22:38.101092,pubmed,2,41405809,1138320000,Selective Role of Intracellular Chloride in the Regulation of the Intrinsic but not Extrinsic Pathway of Apoptosis in Jurkat T-Cells,2232-41,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0021-9258,the-journal-of-biological-chemistry,J.

The channel underwent a fast rundown in less than 2 to 3 minutes of recording, and reactivation required in situ exposure to a phosphorylating ""cocktail"" containing the catalytic subunit of the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase.

D H Ellison,H Velázquez,"Potassium secretion into the renal distal tubule is increased when chloride in the tubule fluid is replaced by another anion. The present experiments were done to determine whether this increment in transported potassium traverses a conductive pathway from cell to lumen. Transport rates of potassium, sodium, chloride, and fluid by the renal distal tubule of rats were examined in vivo by continuous microperfusion. The effects of substituting gluconate for chloride in the presence and absence of 5 mM barium in the perfusion fluid were determined. When gluconate replaced chloride in the perfusion solutions, potassium secretion increased (by 44%) without a significant change in transepithelial voltage. Barium in the lumen increased the magnitude of the lumen-negative transepithelial voltage (by 30%) and reduced potassium secretion (by 56%) by inhibiting conductive potassium movement. Barium also decreased both sodium (by 51%) and chloride (by 37%) absorption. Barium did not reduce the stimulation of potassium secretion caused by reducing lumen chloride concentration. Potassium secretion increased (by 77%) when lumen chloride was reduced in the presence of 5 mM barium. We interpret these results by postulating that a cotransport mechanism linking potassium and chloride is present in the luminal membrane of distal tubule cells, that this mechanism operates in parallel with a conductive transport pathway for potassium, and that the K-Cl cotransport mechanism is not inhibited by barium.",2020-04-30T19:21:30.924035,pubmed,3,29358353,483753600,Stimulation of Distal Potassium Secretion by Low Lumen Chloride in the Presence of Barium,F638-49,5 Pt 2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-american-journal-of-physiology,Am.

A M Allan,R A Harris,"gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, increases membrane chloride conductance. Previously, the authors reported that GABA increases 36Cl- uptake by membrane vesicles (microsacs) prepared from mouse brain. In the present study, we examined the actions of barbiturates on basal and GABA-stimulated chloride influx by brain vesicles. The anesthetic barbiturates pentobarbital, phenobarbital, mephobarbital, amobarbital, hexobarbital and R-(-)-1-methyl-5-phenyl-5-propyl barbiturate enhanced GABA-dependent chloride flux. Barbiturate enhancement of GABA action was seen at concentrations that are subanesthetic in vivo (e.g., 10 microM pentobarbital was effective). Pentobarbital was about 10 times more potent than pentobarbital, suggesting that chloride flux is related to the sedative rather than anticonvulsant actions of barbiturates. Pentobarbital (1 mM) prevented the antagonism of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- produced by picrotoxinin. The barbiturates generally produced no change in GABA-independent flux, although large concentrations of pentobarbital or hexobarbital produced a slight enhancement of chloride flux in the absence of GABA. The convulsant barbiturate S-(+)-1-methyl-5-phenyl-5-propyl barbiturate inhibited GABA-stimulated chloride flux, an action opposite to that of its anesthetic enantiomer. These experiments provide evidence for a functional coupling among GABA and barbiturate receptors and the chloride ionophore and suggest that the GABA-activated chloride channel is a site of action for intoxicant-anesthetic and convulsant barbiturates.",2020-04-30T18:22:55.763522,pubmed,2,27619201,525916800,Anesthetic and Convulsant Barbiturates Alter Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid-Stimulated Chloride Flux across Brain Membranes,763-8,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-3565,the-journal-of-pharmacology-and-experimental-therapeutics,J.

C K Wong,D K Chan,"High-purity viable cells with low mitochondria (pavement cells) and mitochondria-rich content (chloride cells) were successfully isolated from the gill epithelium of Japanese eels, using three-step Percoll gradient low-speed centrifugation. Cytochemistry (silver staining for chloride, rhodamine-123, and Mitotracker for mitochondria and actin/spectrin immunofluorescence) and scanning electron microscope images were used to identify the cell types in the gill epithelium of the eel. Pavement cells were isolated at 97 and 98% purity for freshwater- and seawater-adapted eels, respectively, and chloride cells were obtained at 89 and 92% purity. The enzymatic activities of the isolated cells were determined. Na+-K+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase, and succinate dehydrogenase were found mainly in the chloride cell. Alkaline Ca2+-ATPase and low- and high-affinity Ca2+-ATPase were about twice as high in the chloride cell compared with the pavement cell. Transfer of eels to seawater resulted in enlargement of chloride cell sizes and significant increases in Na+-K+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase, and succinate dehydrogenase activities, while all Ca2+-ATPases declined by approximately 60-80%. This is the first report demonstrating the successful isolation of freshwater chloride cells and also an exclusive method of getting high-purity seawater chloride cells.

R G Luke,B B Booker,"Microperfusion of the superficial loop segment (latest proximal to earliest distal tubule) was performed in potassium-depleted and control rats. Potassium depletion was confirmed by analysis of muscle content (control 45 +/- 2, potassium depletion 33.5 +/- 0.9 meq/100 g dry solids). During perfusion at 20 nl/min net chloride absorption was decreased (66 +/- 3 vs. 77 +/- 2%, P less than 0.01) and early distal chloride concentration increased (70 +/- 5 vs. 50 +/- 4 meq/liter, P less than 0.01) in the potassium-depleted rats. In separate paired experiments in potassium-depleted rats, indomethacin infusion increased net chloride absorption (P less than 0.05) and lowered early distal chloride concentration (P less than 0.05) toward, but not to, normal. A similar effect of indomethacin to decrease early distal chloride concentration was seen in rats ingesting a normal diet and in control rats. We conclude that in potassium-depleted rats there is impaired net chloride absorption in the loop segment, most likely in the thick ascending limb, and that this effect is not produced by an altered response to prostaglandins. This defect in chloride transport may be responsible, at least in part, for the impaired concentrating capacity seen in potassium-depleted rats.",2020-04-30T19:21:31.250387,pubmed,3,29358560,483753600,Effect of Potassium Depletion on Chloride Transport in the Loop of Henle in the Rat,F682-7,5 Pt 2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-american-journal-of-physiology,Am.

John W Davis,J Martin Odom,"A polyphasic approach based on cultivation and direct recovery of 16S rRNA gene sequences was utilized for microbial characterization of an aquifer contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. This work was conducted in order to support the evaluation of natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in groundwater at Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, DE). Results from these studies demonstrated the aquifer contained relatively low biomass (e.g. direct microscopic counts of < 10(7) bacteria/g of sediment) comprised of a physiologically diverse group of microorganisms including iron reducers, acetogens, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers, aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs. Laboratory microcosms prepared with authentic sediment and groundwater provided direct microbiological evidence that the mineralization of vinyl chloride and cis-dichloroethene as well as each step in the complete reductive dechlorination of tetracloroethene to ethene can occur in the Area 6 aquifer. Enrichment cultures capable of the oxidative degradation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) were obtained from groundwater across the aquifer demonstrating the possible importance of direct, non-cometabolic oxidation of cis-DCE and VC in natural attenuation. Culture-independent analyses based upon recovery of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the presence of anaerobic organisms distributed primarily between two major bacterial divisions: the delta subdivision of the Proteobacteria and low-G + C gram positive. Recovery of sequences affiliated with phylogenetic groups containing known anaerobic-halorespiring organisms such as Desulfitobacterium, Dehalobacter, and certain groups of iron reducers provided qualitative support for a role of reductive dechlorination processes in the aquifer. This molecular data is suggestive of a functional linkage between the microbiology of the site and the apparent natural attenuation process. The presence and distribution of microorganisms were found to be consistent with a microbially driven attenuation of chlorinated ethenes within the aquifer and in accord with a conceptual model of aquifer geochemistry which suggest that both reductive and oxidative mechanisms are involved in heterogeneous, spatially distributed processes across the aquifer.",2020-05-01T06:39:09.568391,pubmed,8,36797642,1025481600,"Natural Attenuation of Chlorinated Solvents at Area 6, Dover Air Force Base: Characterization of Microbial Community Structure",41-59,1-2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0169-7722,journal-of-contaminant-hydrology,J.

K T Mullen,,"A method of producing red-green and blue-yellow sinusoidal chromatic gratings is used which permits the correction of all chromatic aberrations. A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue-yellow and red-green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low-pass characteristics, with no low-frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red-green and blue-yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone.

For hydrophobic polymers, such as polyethylene, neither the physical state of water nor the relative humidity has an influence on the water permeability.

G Turconi,M Guarcello,"The use of a series of three photographs and virtual portion sizes being associated with relatively small errors, our findings support the validity of using this colour food photography atlas as a tool for quantifying food portion size in epidemiological dietary surveys on different age groups of Italian subjects. Multiple regression analysis shows that weights of portion sizes chosen from the set of photographs are significantly associated (P<0.05) to weights of eaten portions (beta=0.81; R(2)=0.70) and are independent of age, gender and BMI. The differences between mean weights of the portions chosen by individuals from photographs and mean weights of eaten foods are significant for all food categories (P<0.05), except for bread. However, because of the very large number of observations, the mean differences are very small (range: from +23.2 g (+11.2%) for first courses to -1.3 g (-2.7%) for bread). Bland-Altman plots show that first courses limits of agreement are wide because the dispersion is increasing while weights are rising. In all, 448 male and female volunteers aged 6-60 y from a wide variety of social backgrounds completed 9075 assessments of food portions eaten at lunch and dinner in relation to a set of colour food photographs during 8 weeks of investigation. The amounts of foods eaten by individuals in five different cafeterias in Pavia, Northern Italy, were weighed by trained investigators at the time of serving and, within 5-10 min of the end of the meal, each subject was asked to quantify all foods consumed with reference to one of the three food photographs or in terms of virtual portions among those shown in the photographs. The colour food photography atlas was prepared by cooking, weighing and taking digital photographs of three portion sizes of 434 foods and beverages typical of the Italian diet.

O Martínez-Pasarell,C Márquez,"We describe a modification of the human sperm-zona-free hamster egg fusion method that permits the study of aneuploidy in sperm-derived pronuclei by multicolour fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH). Zona-free hamster eggs and human spermatozoa were fused and cultured for 15 h in the presence of colcemid (1 microg/ml of medium) to obtain hamster oocytes arrested at metaphase II and human spermatozoa at the pronuclear stage. By applying a whole human genomic DNA probe we confirmed that 100% of pronuclei tested (372/372) were of human origin. One-colour fluorescent in-situ hybridization using a centromeric 18 probe was applied to 919 pronuclei with different dithiothreitol (DTT) pretreatments: 50 mM (10 min) or 25 mM (20 and 25 min). The highest hybridization efficiency was obtained with treatment with 25 mM DTT for 20 min (90.3%). Sex chromosome aneuploidy was analysed by three-colour FISH in a total of 2596 pronuclei from a normal donor. Hybridization efficiency was 98.6%. The disomy rates for X, Y and XY chromosomes (0.11, 0.04 and 0.08% respectively) were similar to data reported for sperm nuclei by three-colour FISH and to those obtained in sperm chromosomes. These results suggest that selection of potentially fertile spermatozoa (spermatozoa able to fertilize zona-free hamster eggs and produce a pronucleus) does not imply chromosomal selection.",2020-05-01T02:08:26.815430,pubmed,5,34854517,859852800,Analysis of Human Sperm-Derived Pronuclei by Three-Colour Fluorescent In-Situ Hybridization,641-5,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0268-1161,human-reproduction-oxford-england,Hum.

R K Airas,,"The physiological concentration of free magnesium in Escherichia coli cells is about 1 mM, and there is almost no chloride in the cell. When the aminoacylation of tRNA by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase was assayed at 1 mM free Mg2+, chloride (and sulphate) ions inhibited the reaction but acetate at the same concentration (< 200 mM) was not inhibitory. When the magnesium concentration was increased to 10 mM there was almost no chloride inhibition any more. Chloride strengthened the PPi inhibition, the Ki(app)(PPi) values at 1 mM free Mg2+ were 140, 120, and 56 microM at 0, 50 and 150 mM KCl, respectively. Chloride weakened the AMP inhibition, the corresponding values for Ki(app)(AMP) were 0.35, 0.5, and 0.9 mM. The value of Km(app)(tRNA(Tyr)) was clearly increased by chloride, being 22, 37, 93, and 240 nM at 0, 50, 100, and 150 mM KCl, respectively. Best-fit analyses of the PPi inhibition, AMP inhibition and Km(app)(tRNA) assays were accomplished using total rate equations. The analysis showed that the only kinetic events which are obligatory to explain the chloride effects are a weakened binding of Mg2+ to the tRNA before the transfer reaction and a weakened binding of Mg2+ to the Tyr-tRNA-enzyme complex after the transfer reaction. The dissociation constants for the former were 0.11, 0.3, and 2.8 mM and for the latter 0.6, 2.5, and 13 mM at 0, 50 and 150 mM KCl, respectively. Mg2+ is required for the reactive conformation of tRNA in the transfer reaction but chloride weakens its formation. After the transfer reaction the dissociation of Mg2+ from the aa-tRNA-enzyme complex enhances the dissociation of the aa-tRNA from the enzyme. The kinetics and the chloride effect were similar in the tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases from both Bacillus stearothermophilus and E. coli.",2020-05-01T06:10:21.588735,pubmed,1,36591291,940204800,Chloride Affects the Interaction between Tyrosyl-Trna Synthetase and Trna,51-61,1-2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0167-4889,biochimica-et-biophysica-acta,Biochim.

R Schlichter,C R Bader,"A chloride current activated by an increase in intracellular calcium concentration is not present in all neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. It is not known whether the trigeminal neurons expressing calcium-activated chloride current belong to a defined class of neurons or whether they could belong to any class of sensory neurons. An answer to this question would be of importance because the physiological role of calcium-activated chloride current in neurons has not yet been completely established, nonetheless it is clear that this current, when activated, would act to modulate neuronal excitability. The goal of this study was to determine whether there was a difference in the expression of calcium-activated chloride current between neurons with and without substance P. The rationale was that the use of this morphological marker, which is present in a substantial fraction of embryonic trigeminal neurons, may give a first estimate of a possible inhomogeneity in the expression of calcium-activated chloride current among different classes of sensory neurons. The study was done on freshly dissociated neurons in order to minimize the influence of the culture conditions on the expression of the current or of substance P. By recording from large samples of neurons in cultures either enriched or depleted in substance P-containing neurons, we found that neurons with substance P expressed calcium-activated chloride current three times less frequently than neurons without substance P. This observation was confirmed by performing the immunocytochemical labelling for substance P immediately after the electrophysiological assessment of the presence or absence of calcium-activated chloride current. This result indicates that calcium-activated chloride current may not be randomly distributed in neurons of a sensory ganglion. It raises the possibility that neurons belonging to certain sensory modalities may need calcium-activated chloride current for their physiological functioning.",2020-04-30T18:48:57.150551,pubmed,5,28380738,599616000,Expression of Substance P and of a Ca2+-Activated Cl- Current in Quail Sensory Trigeminal Neurons,585-94,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0306-4522,neuroscience,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,1588272537,30,1,R Schlichter,2,C R Bader,1989-01-01T00:00:00,1588272537,expression-of-substance-p-and-of-a-ca2-activated-cl-current-in-quail-sensory-trigeminal-neurons,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2475816,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/0306-4522(89)90153-x,2020-04-30T18:48:57.150551,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,D Bertrand,M Dubois-Dauphin,L Bernheim,,,,,,,,,,204,1.484,,,,,,,,,,3,D Bertrand,4,M Dubois-Dauphin,,,,,5,,L Bernheim,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
L S Brown,R Needleman,"When the protonated retinal Schiff base dissociates in the photocycle of the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin, asp-85 is the proton acceptor. Replacing this residue with threonine confers halorhodopsin-like properties on the protein, including chloride transport [Sasaki, J., Brown, L.S., Chon, Y.-S., Kandori, H., Maeda, A., Needleman, R., & Lanyi, J.K. (1995) Science 269, 73-75]. However, the electrostatic interaction between the vicinity of residue 85 and glu-204, a residue located about 10 A away near the extracellular surface, that is a part of the proton transport mechanism, should still exist. We find that in the D85T mutant glu-204 becomes protonated when chloride is added. This indicates that the binding of chloride at thr-85 must be equivalent to deprotonation of asp-85. The protonation state of glu-204 reports therefore on the presence or absence of chloride bound at thr-85. During the chloride-transport cycle of D85T, but not D85T/E204Q, fluorescein and pyranine detect the transient release of protons from the protein to the surface and the bulk. The release and the subsequent uptake of the protons occur during the rise and decay of a red-shifted photointermediate, respectively, and confirm the earlier suggestion that this state has the same role in the chloride transport as the M intermediate in the proton transport. Consistent with the red-shift of the absorption maximum, the chloride bound near the Schiff base had already moved away, presumably to be released at the cytoplasmic surface, but another chloride ion has not yet been taken up from the extracellular surface. The switch of the connectivity of the chloride binding site from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular membrane surface must occur therefore during the lifetime of this photointermediate.",2020-05-01T02:13:14.584733,pubmed,3,34889791,850780800,Interaction of Proton and Chloride Transfer Pathways in Recombinant Bacteriorhodopsin with Chloride Transport Activity: Implications for the Chloride Translocation Mechanism,16048-54,50,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0006-2960,biochemistry,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,1588299194,35,1,L S Brown,2,R Needleman,1996-12-17T00:00:00,1588299194,interaction-of-proton-and-chloride-transfer-pathways-in-recombinant-bacteriorhodopsin-with-chloride-transport-activity-implications-for-the-chloride-translocation-mechanism,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/bi9622938,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8973174,2020-05-01T02:13:14.584733,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,J K Lanyi,,,,,,,,,,,,231,1.556,,,,,,,,,,3,J K Lanyi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,nonprogrammatic,,,,,,nonprogrammatic,nonprogrammatic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N Vardi,L L Zhang,"GABA gating an anion channel primarily permeable to chloride can hyperpolarize or depolarize, depending on whether the chloride equilibrium potential (E(Cl)) is negative or positive, respectively, to the resting membrane potential (E(rest)). If the transmembrane Cl(-) gradient is set by active transport, those neurons or neuronal regions that exhibit opposite responses to GABA should express different chloride transporters. To test this, we immunostained retina for the K-Cl cotransporter (KCC2) that normally extrudes chloride and for the Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC) that normally accumulates chloride. KCC2 was expressed wherever E(Cl) is either known or predicted to be negative to E(rest) (ganglion cells, bipolar axons, and OFF bipolar dendrites), whereas NKCC was expressed wherever E(Cl) is either known or predicted to be positive to E(rest) (horizontal cells and ON bipolar dendrites). Thus, in the retina, the opposite effects of GABA on different cell types and on different cellular regions are probably primarily determined by the differential targeting of these two chloride transporters.",2020-05-01T06:05:33.362382,pubmed,4,36559393,971568000,Evidence that Different Cation Chloride Cotransporters in Retinal Neurons Allow Opposite Responses to Gaba,7657-63,20,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0270-6474,the-journal-of-neuroscience-the-official-journal-of-the-society-for-neuroscience,J.

All were exposed in a chamber (21 degrees C, 50% humidity) to 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 ppm SO2 in random order at 1-wk intervals; then exposures were repeated to test consistency of response. The 1-h exposures included three 10-min exercise periods (ventilation approximately 40 L/min). Physiologic response was measured early (approximately 15 min) and late (approximately 55 min) in exposure. Symptoms were evaluated during exposure and for 1 wk afterward. Normal and most atopic subjects showed little response at these SO2 levels. A few atopic subjects and many asthmatics developed bronchoconstriction and respiratory symptoms, but most were able to maintain their exercise. Effects were not markedly different between early and late measurements, nor between the first and second round of studies; however, late and second-round responses appeared slightly more favorable. No statistically significant effect of SO2 on symptoms was found 1 day or 1 wk after exposure. Minimal/mild asthmatics showed, on the average, slight responses at 0.0 ppm (attributable to exercise) and increasing responses at increasing SO2 concentrations. Moderate/severe asthmatics reacted more at 0.0 ppm, but their increments in response with increasing SO2 concentration were roughly similar to those of minimal/mild asthmatics. Thus, responses to SO2 per se were not strongly dependent on clinical severity of asthma, nor on SO2 exposure history during previous weeks.",2020-04-30T19:20:40.544471,pubmed,5,29332413,562723200,"Replicated Dose-Response Study of Sulfur Dioxide Effects in Normal, Atopic, and Asthmatic Volunteers",1127-34,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-american-review-of-respiratory-disease,Am.

G Michetti,G Mosconi,"The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of two groups of hard metal workers (11 subjects) were examined and compared with BALs of 14 unexposed individuals as controls. The first group of workers included five asymptomatic subjects (2 females and 3 males) with normal lung function tests and chest X-rays. All the workers had been exposed daily to hard metal dust for 5 years before fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The second group of workers included six individuals (1 female and 5 males) with cobalt lung disease at biopsy. The BAL's cytology at the deep lung level is in agreement with a possible immunologic pathogenesis of the lung disease, similar to hypersensitivity pneumonitis (lymphocytosis with helper-suppressor ratio reduction).

T Kondo,V Misík,"Stabilized microbubbles (microspheres) are widely used to enhance the contrast of ultrasound imaging. Our data provide direct evidence that the contrast agents, Levovist, PVC-AN (polyvinylidene chloride-acrylonitryl copolymer), and Albunex (compared to 5% human albumin), at concentrations comparable to those used for ultrasound imaging, enhance H2O2 production (through the superoxide-dependent pathway) in air-saturated aqueous solutions exposed to 47 kHz ultrasound above the cavitation threshold. These agents also act as scavengers of .H atoms and .OH radicals, thus lowering H2O2 formation (by recombination of .OH radicals) in argon-saturated solutions. EPR spin trapping also reveals that secondary radicals derived from the contrast agents are produced by reactions with .H and .OH which are formed by pyrolysis of water inside cavitation bubbles. In addition, the contrast agents themselves undergo pyrolysis reactions in the cavitation bubbles as demonstrated by formation of methyl radicals. Possible deleterious consequences of the formation of sonochemical intermediates may have to be assessed, particularly since some of the echo contrast agents have been shown to lower the cavitation threshold of diagnostic ultrasound. Unlike the microspheres formed from organic molecules, inorganic microspheres, Eccospheres, because of their stability and inert nature with respect to participation in free radical processes, appear to be suitable tools for enhancing the yields of aqueous sonochemical reactions.",2020-05-01T02:39:01.230986,pubmed,3,35077833,904608000,Effect of Gas-Containing Microspheres and Echo Contrast Agents on Free Radical Formation by Ultrasound,605-12,4-5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,free-radical-biology-medicine,Free Radic.

Linyi Zhai,Ruchi Shukla,"DDQ/H(+) system readily oxidizes a variety of electron donors with oxidation potential as high as approximately 1.7 V to the corresponding cation radicals. A re-examination of the controversial arenium-ion versus cation-radical mechanisms for Scholl reaction using DDQ/H(+) together with commonly utilized FeCl(3) as oxidants led us to demonstrate that the reaction proceeds largely via a cation-radical mechanism. The critical experimental evidence in support of a cation-radical pathway for the Scholl reaction includes the following: (i) There is no reaction in Scholl precursors in a mixture of dichloromethane and various acids (10% v/v). (ii) The necessity to use powerful oxidants such as ferric chloride (FeCl(3)) or DDQ/H(+) for Scholl reactions is inconsistent with the arenium-ion mechanism in light of the fact that aromatization of the dihydro intermediates (formed via arenium-ion mechanism) can be easily accomplished with rather weak oxidants such as iodine or air. (iii) Various Scholl precursors with oxidation potentials 1.7 V vs SCE do not react. (iv) Finally, the feasibility of the dicationic intermediate, formed by loss of two electrons, has been demonstrated by its generation from a tetraphenylene derivative using DDQ/H(+) as an oxidant.",2020-05-02T02:17:53.140767,pubmed,4,44869212,1279238400,Probing the Arenium-Ion (Protontransfer) Versus the Cation-Radical (Electron Transfer) Mechanism of Scholl Reaction using Ddq as Oxidant,4748-60,14,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-3263,the-journal-of-organic-chemistry,J.

Karen L Jansen,Timothy V Larson,"We measured fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)), spirometry, blood pressure, oxygen saturation of the blood (SaO2), and pulse rate in 16 older subjects with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Seattle, Washington. Data were collected daily for 12 days. We simultaneously collected PM10 and PM2.5 (particulate matter < or = 10 microm or < or = 2.5 microm, respectively) filter samples at a central outdoor site, as well as outside and inside the subjects' homes. Personal PM10 filter samples were also collected. All filters were analyzed for mass and light absorbance. We analyzed within-subject associations between health outcomes and air pollution metrics using a linear mixed-effects model with random intercept, controlling for age, ambient relative humidity, and ambient temperature. For the 7 subjects with asthma, a 10 microg/m3 increase in 24-hr average outdoor PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with a 5.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.9-8.9] and 4.2 ppb (95% CI, 1.3-7.1) increase in FE(NO), respectively. A 1 microg/m3 increase in outdoor, indoor, and personal black carbon (BC) was associated with increases in FE(NO) of 2.3 ppb (95% CI, 1.1-3.6), 4.0 ppb (95% CI, 2.0-5.9), and 1.2 ppb (95% CI, 0.2-2.2), respectively. No significant association was found between PM or BC measures and changes in spirometry, blood pressure, pulse rate, or SaO2 in these subjects. Results from this study indicate that FE(NO) may be a more sensitive marker of PM exposure than traditional health outcomes and that particle-associated BC is useful for examining associations between primary combustion constituents of PM and health outcomes.",2020-05-01T17:22:47.622546,pubmed,7,41410215,1133395200,Associations between Health Effects and Particulate Matter and Black Carbon in Subjects with Respiratory Disease,1741-6,12,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0091-6765,environmental-health-perspectives,Environ.

A Iwasawa,Y Nakamura,"Acidic electrolyzed water is made recently by various kinds of machines and is widely utilized. In this study, we intended to clarify the relationship between the concentration of chloride and pH in the bactericidal effects with acidic electrolyzed water. The effects of weak or strong acidic electrolyzed water were compared with a pseudo-acidic water of pH adjusted by diluted hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, on Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomononas aeruginosa. At pH 5.0 approximately 6.0, 3 bacterial strains were killed soon after being exposed to the acidic water containing chloride 50 mg/liter, and the amount of chloride did not change after allowing to stand open for 6 hours. At pH 2.67 approximately 2.80, the bactericidal effects was observed at the concentration of chloride 5 mg/liter, and 80% of chloride remained after allowing to stand for 6 hours. These results indicated that newly made strong acidic water is more effective under a smaller amount of chloride at pH 2.7, and that weak acidic electrolyzed water should be used, if stable bactericidal effect is expected in cleaning the surroundings.",2020-05-01T00:15:01.461968,pubmed,2,34042247,841536000,Bactericidal Effect of Acidic Electrolyzed Water--Comparison of Chemical Acidic Sodium Hydrochloride (Naocl) Solution,915-22,9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,kansenshogaku-zasshi-the-journal-of-the-japanese-association-for-infectious-diseases,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku Zasshi. the Journal of the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases,1588292101,70,1,A Iwasawa,2,Y Nakamura,1996-09-01T00:00:00,1588292101,bactericidal-effect-of-acidic-electrolyzed-water-comparison-of-chemical-acidic-sodium-hydrochloride-naocl-solution,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8921674,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.11150/kansenshogakuzasshi1970.70.915,2020-05-01T00:15:01.461968,english-abstract,english abstract,comparative-study,comparative study,english-abstract,english abstract,comparative-study,comparative study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D J Bird,B I Baker,"The melanin-concentrating hormone is a general vertebrate neurosecretory peptide which, in bony fish, serves as a neurohypophysial hormone influencing pigmentary changes in response to background colour. Young carp were reared for six months in white- or black-coloured tanks to determine how this would influence the development of the neurons producing the peptide. Cytological criteria and radioimmunoassay of tissue extracts showed that the background markedly influenced the synthetic activity of these neurons. In carp reared in black tanks, the perikarya were small and poorly granulated, with small nuclei and often undetectable nucleoli. Transfer of such fish to a white tank for six days caused no significant change in hormone content but cytological criteria suggested an increased activity of some of the neurons. In fish reared on a white background, over 50% of these neurons showed a greatly enhanced synthetic activity, while radioimmunoassays showed significantly higher concentrations of immunoreactive peptide in their hypothalami but not in their pituitary glands. After such fish were moved to black tanks for six days, the neuropeptide content of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland was significantly increased. Histologically, this was reflected in the amount of immunostainable granulation in both sites but cell nuclear size was not decreased. These changes are interpreted in terms of changes of hormone synthesis and release.

H Kopelman,M Corey,"Pancreatic fluid and electrolyte secretion was assessed in 56 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 56 non-CF control subjects undergoing pancreatic function testing while stimulated with cholecystokinin and secretin. Both CF patients and control subjects exhibited a wide range of pancreatic function. Fluid and trypsin outputs were positively correlated in both groups. Fluid output in CF subjects was significantly lower, however, than that of control subjects at any given level of trypsin output. Sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride secretions were all significantly decreased in CF subjects. Bicarbonate and chloride were important determinants of fluid secretion, but at any given bicarbonate or chloride output CF subjects secreted significantly less fluid than control subjects. When bicarbonate and chloride were analyzed as simultaneous predictor variables, adjusted fluid secretion was not significantly different in CF and control subjects.

Matthijs Bonte,John J G Zwolsman,"In this paper we present a modelling study to investigate the impacts of climate change on the chloride concentration and salinisation processes in two man-made freshwater lakes in the Netherlands, Lake IJsselmeer and Lake Markermeer. We used a transient compartmental chloride and water balance model to elucidate the salinisation processes occurring under present conditions and assess future salinisation under two climate forcing scenarios. The model results showed that the Rhine River is the dominant determinant for the chloride concentration in both lakes, followed by drainage of brackish groundwater from the surrounding polders. The results further show that especially during dry years, seawater intrusion through the tidal closure dam is an important source of chloride to Lake IJsselmeer. The results from the climatic forcing scenarios show that Lake IJsselmeer is especially vulnerable to climate-induced salinisation whereas effects on Lake Markermeer are relatively small. Peak chloride concentrations at the raw water intake of the Andijk drinking water facility on Lake IJsselmeer are projected to increase to values above 250 mg/l in the most far-reaching climate change scenario W+ in 2050 for dry years. This is well above the maximum allowable concentration of 150 mg/l for chloride in drinking water. Modelling showed that climate change impacts the chloride concentrations in a variety of ways: 1) an increasing occurrence of low river flows from summer to autumn reduces the dilution of the chloride that is emitted to the Rhine with a constant load thereby increasing its concentration; 2) increased open water evaporation and reduced rainfall during summer periods and droughts increases the chloride concentration in the water; and 3) rises in sea level increase seawater intrusion through the tidal closure dam of Lake IJsselmeer. The processes described here are likely to affect many other tidal rivers or lakes and should be considered when planning future raw water intake stations for drinking water production or agricultural water supply.",2020-05-02T02:40:47.522110,pubmed,2,45092616,1280620800,Climate Change Induced Salinisation of Artificial Lakes in the Netherlands and Consequences for Drinking Water Production,4411-24,15,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0043-1354,water-research,Water Res.,Water Research,1588387247,44,1,Matthijs Bonte,2,John J G Zwolsman,2010-08-01T00:00:00,1588387247,climate-change-induced-salinisation-of-artificial-lakes-in-the-netherlands-and-consequences-for-drinking-water-production,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/j.watres.2010.06.004,,pii,,S0043-1354(10)00379-9,2020-05-02T02:40:47.522110,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,263,2.721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,2580852,Matthijs Bonte,matthijs-bonte,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20580400,,,TRUE,2580852,Matthijs Bonte,matthijs-bonte,matthijs-bonte,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D Wagner,M Tissot,"Within a colony of harvester ants (Pogonomyrmex barbatus), workers in different task groups differ in the hydrocarbon composition of the cuticle. Foragers and patrollers, which spend extended periods of time outside the nest, have a higher proportion of saturated, unbranched hydrocarbons (n-alkanes) on the cuticle than nest maintenance workers, which spend only short periods of time outside the nest. We tested whether these task-related differences in ant cuticular chemistry arise from exposure to conditions outside the nest. Nest maintenance workers experiencing daily, short-term outside exposure developed a higher proportion of n-alkanes on the cuticle than workers kept inside the lab. Independent manipulations of ultraviolet radiation, relative humidity, and temperature revealed that only the combination of high temperature (ca. 38 degrees C) and low relative humidity (ca. 8%) increased the proportion of cuticular n-alkanes. The results indicate that warm dry conditions, such as those encountered when an ant leaves the nest, trigger changes in cuticular chemistry.",2020-05-01T06:30:03.731664,pubmed,3,36729912,999302400,Task-Related Environment Alters the Cuticular Hydrocarbon Composition of Harvester Ants,1805-19,9,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0098-0331,journal-of-chemical-ecology,J.

R C Morrow,T M Crabb,"The Biomass Production System (BPS) was developed under the Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) program to meet science, biotechnology and commercial plant growth needs in the Space Station era. The BPS is equivalent in size to a double middeck locker, but uses its own custom enclosure with a slide out structure to which internal components mount. The BPS contains four internal growth chambers, each with a growing volume of more than 4 liters. Each of the growth chambers has active nutrient delivery, and independent control of temperature, humidity, lighting, and CO2 set-points. Temperature control is achieved using a thermoelectric heat exchanger system. Humidity control is achieved using a heat exchanger with a porous interface which can both humidify and dehumidify. The control software utilizes fuzzy logic for nonlinear, coupled temperature and humidity control. The fluorescent lighting system can be dimmed to provide a range of light levels. CO2 levels are controlled by injecting pure CO2 to the system based on input from an infrared gas analyzer. The unit currently does not scrub CO2, but has been designed to accept scrubber cartridges. In addition to providing environmental control, a number of features are included to facilitate science. The BPS chambers are sealed to allow CO2 and water vapor exchange measurements. The plant chambers can be removed to allow manipulation or sampling of specimens, and each chamber has gas/fluid sample ports. A video camera is provided for each chamber, and frame-grabs and complete environmental data for all science and hardware system sensors are stored on an internal hard drive. Data files can also be transferred to 3.5-inch disks using the front panel disk drive.",2020-05-01T06:19:29.999673,pubmed,2,36653556,946684800,Biomass Production System (Bps) Plant Growth Unit,289-98,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,advances-in-space-research-the-official-journal-of-the-committee-on-space-research-cospar,Adv Space Res,Advances in Space Research : the Official Journal of the Committee on Space Research (Cospar),1588313969,26,1,R C Morrow,2,T M Crabb,2000-01-01T00:00:00,1588313969,biomass-production-system-bps-plant-growth-unit,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11543164,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/s0273-1177(99)00573-6,2020-05-01T06:19:29.999673,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,,,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R Fernández Patier,M Esteban Lefler,"Precipitation samples have been gathered using recipients that differentiate the dry deposition of the humidity in three stations in Spain: one urban (Madrid) and two at base levels (San Pablo de los Montes and Granada). The study is centred on the components of an acid character, for which significant special variations of the sulphate and nitrate concentrations have been obtained. The levels, highest in Madrid and lowest in San Pablo, show the influence of the emitting focal points. A study of the seasonal variations in San Pablo show that the concentrations in summer are more than double than those in winter, probably due to the intervention of the photochemical formation processes of these contaminants. Also studies of humidity deposition are carried out, from which one can observe greater monthly values that are greater in Madrid than in other stations, in spite of having less rainfall.

Under conditions in which chloride entry was minimized, i.e., low (6 mM) external chloride concentration plus voltage clamping, 5 microM 8-BrcAMP consistently and significantly inhibited proton transport by 40-60% in all six fractions. Under the same low chloride conditions, 250 microM 8-BrcAMP inhibited proton transport by 80-90% in all six fractions. These studies indicate that 8-BrcAMP can modify endosomal transport in a heterogeneous manner, that 8-BrcAMP inhibits the H+-ATPase directly, and that this effect is significantly modified by chloride. Last, these studies suggest that the observed heterogeneity in proton transport arises from interaction of 8-BrcAMP and chloride.",2020-04-30T18:37:40.160703,pubmed,2,28044118,625881600,Heterogeneity of Camp Effect on Endosomal Proton Transport,F777-84,5 Pt 2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-american-journal-of-physiology,Am.

M V Rapallino,A Cupello,"1. Data obtained studying permeability characteristics of single Deiters' membranes in a microchamber system show that intracellular GABA can activate chloride in-->out passage with a GABAA pharmacology. 2. The overall data suggest the presence of a chloride extrusion pump in these neurons based on intracellular GABA activated chloride channels. 3. This conclusion takes up a previous theoretical suggestion that ionic channels could work as ionic pumps provided an energy input modifies the energy profile along the permeation path. 4. According to our quantitative evaluation, this pumping mechanism works with a low yield and along a cycle with a strongly asymmetric behavior, being far from equilibrium due to powerful ""leakage"" pathways for chloride in these neurons.",2020-05-01T03:29:48.137729,pubmed,3,35477656,944006400,An Electrogenic Ionic Pump Derived from an Ionotropic Receptor: Assessment of a Candidate,681-90,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0272-4340,cellular-and-molecular-neurobiology,Cell.

L Epstein,A R Sayed,"Respiratory diseases are major causes of death in South Africa. The reported mortality rates (MRs) for: (i) pneumonia and influenza; (ii) chronic obstructive lung disease and allied conditions; (iii) pulmonary tuberculosis; and (iv) carcinoma of the lung and bronchus over a 5-year period are examined in relation to age, sex, ethnic group and year. Such data have not previously been reported in South Africa. MRs for all respiratory diseases (except lung carcinoma) were substantially higher in coloureds than in whites or Asians. In each ethnic group and for each disease category, MRs for males were higher than for females, especially in those over the age of 24 years. For all, except lung carcinoma, MRs were highest at the extremes of life. Changes in respiratory disease MRs over the 5-year period were examined by calculating the age standardised MRs for each condition in each of the 5 years. There was a clear decline in the MR for pneumonia over this period in all groups. The MR for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease rose in all groups, except Asian females. Similarly, the MR for carcinoma increased in all groups, except white females. The MR for tuberculosis was highest in coloured males (10 times greater than in Asian males and 100 times greater than in white females). The pattern of respiratory disease MRs in white South Africans is very similar to that in the USA, whereas in coloureds MRs for infectious diseases remain high and are added to by the burden of cigarette smoking-related deaths.",2020-04-30T19:18:03.550516,pubmed,4,29251275,561427200,"Variations in Mortality of the Coloured, White and Asian Population Groups in the Rsa, 1978-1982. part Iv.

B Santucci,C Cannistraci,"The aim of this paper was to evaluate whether methylmercury chloride (MeHgCl) aq., when patch tested in a group of thimerosal-positive subjects reacting to ethylmercury chloride (EtHgCl), might be a reliable model for the better understanding of interactions between alkylmercury compounds and the skin. 19 out of 21 consecutive patients who previously had given positive patch-test reactions to both ethylmercury chloride 0.0165% eth.(EtHgCl, 0.615 mM) and MeHgCl 0.031% aq.(1.23 mM), and negative reactions to thiosalicylic acid 0.05% (3.24 mM) aq./eth. 50/50, were repatch tested to 8 microl of MeHgCl 0.031% aq. and to 8 microl of aq. solutions containing MeHgCl mixed with cysteine, glutathione, ZnSO4, MgSO4, MnSO4, ZnCl2, MgCl2 and MnCl2, respectively. The results showed that cysteine, glutathione and Zn(II) salts were able to abolish the positive reactions, demonstrating the rôle played by both thiol groups and Zn(II) itself. Patch tests concomitantly carried out in 16 out of 19 patients to 8 microl of aqueous MeHgCl and to 8 microl of aqueous solutions containing MeHgCl and MeHgCl mixed to fragment 56-61 of metallothionein I (MT I), MT I and MT II-Zn, respectively, revealed that all the MTs tested were able to reduce or to inhibit the reactions, demonstrating the effect of the thiol groups. Due to the close chemical similarities to EtHgCl and to its water solubility, MeHgCl seems to be a suitable model for evaluating the reactivity of alkylmercury compounds in the skin. We speculate that both EtHg- and MeHg-derivatives are xenobiotics with similar reactivity. However, the lack of clinical relevance of the reactions to both alkyl compounds lead us to conclude that, since environmental exposure does not seem to play a pivotal rôle, they probably have mostly to do with compounds included in in the standard series, and are elicited by reduced function of physiological SH chelators.",2020-05-01T03:13:36.497706,pubmed,5,35351383,915148800,Thimerosal Positivities: Patch Testing to Methylmercury Chloride in Subjects Sensitive to Ethylmercury Chloride,8-13,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0105-1873,contact-dermatitis,Contact Derm.,Contact Dermatitis,1588302816,40,1,B Santucci,2,C Cannistraci,1999-01-01T00:00:00,1588302816,thimerosal-positivities-patch-testing-to-methylmercury-chloride-in-subjects-sensitive-to-ethylmercury-chloride,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1111/j.1600-0536.1999.tb05969.x,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9928798,2020-05-01T03:13:36.497706,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,A Cristaudo,E Camera,M Picardo,,,,,,,,,,88,0.524,,,,,,,,,,3,A Cristaudo,4,E Camera,TRUE,5110493,Mauro Picardo,mauro-picardo,5,mauro-picardo,M Picardo,TRUE,5110493,Mauro Picardo,mauro-picardo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J Schwartz,,"Many studies have reported associations between air pollution and daily deaths. Those studies have not consistently specified the lag between exposure and response, although most have found associations that persisted for more than 1 day. A systematic approach to specifying the lag association would allow better comparison across sites and give insight into the nature of the relation. To examine this question, I fit unconstrained and constrained distributed lag relations to the association between daily deaths of persons 65 years of age and older with PM10 in 10 U.S. cities (New Haven, Birmingham, Pittsburgh, Canton, Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis, Colorado Springs, Spokane, and Seattle) that had daily monitoring for PM10. After control for temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, day of the week, and seasonal patterns, I found evidence in each city that the effect of a single day's exposure to PM10 was manifested across several days. Averaging over the 10 cities, the overall effect of an increase in exposure of 10 microg/m3 on a single day was a 1.4% increase in deaths (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.15-1.68) using a quadratic distributed lag model, and a 1.3% increase (95% CI = 1.04-1.56) using an unconstrained distributed lag model. In contrast, constraining the model to assume the effect all occurs in one day resulted in an estimate of only 0.65% (95% CI = 0.49-0.81), indicating that this constraint leads to a substantial underestimate of effect. Combining the estimated effect at each day's lag across the 10 cities showed that the effect was spread over several days and did not reach zero until 5 days after the exposure. Given the distribution of sensitivities likely in the general population, this result is biologically plausible. I also found a protective effect of barometric pressure in all 10 locations.",2020-05-01T06:13:39.128286,pubmed,1,36613679,957139200,The Distributed Lag between Air Pollution and Daily Deaths,320-6,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1044-3983,epidemiology-cambridge-mass,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",1588313619,11,1,J Schwartz,,,2000-05-01T00:00:00,1588313619,the-distributed-lag-between-air-pollution-and-daily-deaths,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10784251,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1097/00001648-200005000-00016,2020-05-01T06:13:39.128286,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,,,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,155,2.348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C Bauters,J M Lablanche,"These results demonstrate the healing of unstable plaques in the months following PTCA. The angioscopic appearance at 6 months is that of a stable plaque (smooth concentric, white, without thrombus). Whether this stable angioscopic appearance predicts long-term clinical stability remains to be determined. Pre-PTCA, plaque morphology was defined as complex in 18%, ulcerated in 27%; the vessel was totally occluded in 18% of cases. Plaque colour was yellow in 75% of patients. A thrombus was identified at the lesion site in 71% of patients. Immediately post-PTCA, small surface disruptions and dissections were observed in 62% of patients. Plaque colour was yellow in 85% of cases. Seventy-seven percent of patients had an angioscopically visible thrombus at the PTCA site. At follow-up, however, plaque shape was almost uniformly classified as smooth concentric (93%); plaque colour was white in 93%; no thrombus was observed. We studied 15 patients who underwent successful PTCA for an unstable coronary syndrome (unstable angina: n = 5; recent myocardial infarction: n = 10). Angioscopy was performed immediately before PTCA in 14 patients, immediately after PTCA in 13 patients, and at follow-up (225 +/- 62 days after PTCA) in all patients. Coronary angioscopy is a relatively new technique to assess plaque morphology. Previous angioscopic studies have shown that unstable coronary lesions are characterized by complex morphology, evidence of plaque rupture, and intraluminal thrombi. No serial angioscopic studies have investigated the effects of PTCA on plaque morphology at such lesions.

R Isler,P Kirk,"The relative conspicuities of six test garments (fluorescent orange, green/red, high-contrast, fluorescent lime-yellow, white, black) were assessed to guide the selection process of a standard upper body safety garment to be used within the New Zealand logging industry. Six male and four female participants, aged between 18 and 26 years, volunteered to perform 10 trials each on a demanding, central (tracking) task, while peripherally searching colour slides for test garments displayed on each of eight positions, against a pine forest background typically found in the New Zealand forestry. During each trial, transparency luminance was first gradually increased from darkness to daylight and then decreased to darkness again within 180 s. A head mounted ASL eye tracking system (4000SU) recorded the eye line of gaze for each participant, enabling a rank order of detection to be obtained for the tested garments in each trial. The fluorescent lime-yellow, fluorescent orange and white test garments were detected earlier than any other test garments across all trials, and the fluorescent lime-yellow test garment was detected first with a higher frequency than the white test garment. It was concluded that while white may be the most visible colour in near darkness conditions, as it provides highest contrast, fluorescent lime-yellow stands out better in twilight and daylight conditions against the pine forest background.

Samaneh Karimi,Ali Abdulkhani,"The efficiency of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), enzymatic treatment and combined enzymatic/AOP sequences for the colour remediation of soda and chemimechanical pulp and paper mill effluent was investigated. The results indicated that under all circumstances, the AOP using ultraviolet irradiation (photo-Fenton) was more efficient in the degradation of effluent components in comparison with the dark reaction. It was found that both versatile peroxidase (VP) from Bjerkandera adusta and laccase from Trametes versicolor, as pure enzymes, decolorize the deep brown effluent to a clear light-yellow solution. In addition, it was found that in the laccase treatment, the decolorization rates of both effluents were enhanced in the presence of 2, 2'-azinobis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate), while in the case of VP, Mn(+2) decreased the efficiency of the decolorization treatment.

M Martina,S Royer,"The GABA responses of fast-spiking (FS) interneurons and regular-spiking (RS) principal cells were studied using whole cell and perforated-patch recordings in slices of the basolateral amygdala, neo-, and perirhinal cortex. In these three areas, responses to exogenous and synaptically released GABA were abolished by GABA(A) receptor antagonists in FS cells but also included a GABA(B) component in RS cells. Moreover, E(GABA(A)) of FS and RS cells differed from the calculated E(Cl) (-61 mV), but in opposite direction (FS, -54 mV; RS, -72 mV). This was not due to a differential dialysis of FS and RS cells by the pipette solution because the discrepancy persisted when recordings were obtained with the perforated-patch-clamp technique, using the cation-selective ionophore gramicidin. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of cation-chloride cotransporters revealed that the differing E(GABA(A)) of FS and RS neurons arises from cell-type-specific chloride homeostatic mechanisms. Indeed, the prevalent regulators of the intracellular chloride concentration are cotransporters that accumulate chloride in FS cells and extrude chloride in RS neurons. Thus, our results suggest that in the basolateral amygdala as well as in the parietal and perirhinal cortices, FS interneurons are more excitable than principal cells not only by virtue of their dissimilar electroresponsive properties but also because they express a different complement of GABA receptors and chloride homeostatic mechanisms.",2020-05-01T06:33:38.278622,pubmed,3,36755840,1007164800,Cell-Type-Specific Gaba Responses and Chloride Homeostasis in the Cortex and Amygdala,2887-95,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-3077,journal-of-neurophysiology,J.

P Tikuisis,M B Ducharme,"Early studies have demonstrated that rectal temperature (T(re)) decreases and mean skin temperature (Tsk) increases in subjects changing their posture from standing to supine, and vice versa. Such changes have important implications insofar as thermal stress experiments are conducted and interpreted. However, the extent of these changes between steady-state conditions is not known. In addition, it is not known whether thermal balance is also affected by postural changes. To examine these questions, 11 healthy males were exposed to a thermoneutral air environment (28.2-28.5 degrees C and 40% relative humidity) in various postures at rest. Body temperatures, heat losses, and metabolic rate were measured. Subjects wore shorts only and began in an upright posture (standing or sitting at an inclination of 7.5 degrees) on a customized tilt-table. They were tilted twice, once into a supine position and then back to the original upright position. Each tilt occurred after steady state was satisfied based on the subject's circadian variation of T(re) determined previously in a 4.25 h control supine trial. Times to supine steady state following the first tilt were [mean(SE)] 92.6 (6.4) and 116.6 (5.1) min for the standing and sitting trials, respectively. Times to upright steady state following the second tilt were 107.9 (11.4) and 124.1 (9.0) min. Mean steady-state T(re) and Tsk were 36.87 (0.07) and 34.04 (0.14), 37.47 (0.09) and 33.48 (0.14), and 37.26 (0.05) and 33.49 (0.10) degrees C for supine, standing, and sitting, respectively. Thermal balance was attained in all steady-state conditions, and allowing for a decrease in the weighting factor of T(re) for mean body temperature in the upright postures, it also appears that thermal balance was preserved between changes in posture. These results are consistent with no perceived changes by the subjects in their thermal comfort and skin wetness.",2020-05-01T00:34:25.330516,pubmed,2,34186808,820454400,The Effect of Postural Changes on Body Temperatures and Heat Balance,451-9,5-6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,european-journal-of-applied-physiology-and-occupational-physiology,Eur J Appl Physiol Occup Physiol,European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology,1588293265,72,1,P Tikuisis,2,M B Ducharme,1996-01-01T00:00:00,1588293265,the-effect-of-postural-changes-on-body-temperatures-and-heat-balance,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/bf00242275,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8925816,2020-05-01T00:34:25.330516,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
T Hayakawa,M Yoshinari,"The immobilization of cell-adhesive proteins onto titanium implants improves biological response at the implant-tissue interface. Previous studies demonstrated the easy and direct attachment of fibronectin onto titanium with the use of a 2,2,2-trifluoroethanesulfonyl chloride (tresyl chloride) activation technique. The present study investigated the initial adsorption behavior of fibronectin on tresyl chloride-activated titanium by the quartz-crystal microbalance-dissipation (QCM-D) technique. The crystal resonant frequency and the dissipation shift of the oscillator were simultaneously measured by the injection of fibronectin/phosphate-buffered saline solution (pH = 7.4). The tresyl chloride-activated titanium surface showed a faster and greater decrease in frequency than that of untreated titanium, indicating that a greater amount of fibronectin was adsorbed in the former case during a 120-min adsorption. The dissipation-frequency plots revealed that, during the initial stage of adsorption, the bond between fibronectin and tresyl chloride-activated titanium is stronger than that between fibronectin and untreated titanium. The QCM-D technique can provide new insights into the adsorption mechanism of fibronectin.",2020-05-01T17:24:59.378601,pubmed,3,41471468,1114905600,Quartz-Crystal Microbalance-Dissipation Technique for the Study of Initial Adsorption of Fibronectin onto Tresyl Chloride-Activated Titanium,271-6,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1552-4973,journal-of-biomedical-materials-research-part-b-applied-biomaterials,J.

A Stil,S Liabeuf,"The classical GABA/glycine hyperpolarizing inhibition is not observed in the immature spinal cord. GABA(A) and glycine receptors are anions channels and the efficacy of inhibitory transmission in the spinal cord is largely determined by the gradient between intracellular and extracellular chloride concentrations. The concentration of intracellular chloride in neurons is mainly regulated by two cation-chloride cotransporters, the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and the sodium-potassium-chloride co-transporter 1 (NKCC1). In this study, we measured the reversal potential of IPSPs (E(IPSP)) of lumbar motoneurons during the first postnatal week and we investigated the expression of KCC2 and NKCC1 in the ventral horn of the spinal cord from the embryonic day 17 to the postnatal day 20 in the rat. Our results suggest that the negative shift of E(IPSP) from above to below the resting membrane potential occurs during the first postnatal week when the expression of KCC2 increases significantly and the expression of NKCC1 decreases. KCC2 immunolabeling surrounded motoneurons, presumably in the plasma membrane and NKCC1 immunolabeling appeared outside this KCC2-labeled fine strip. Taken together, the present results indicate that maturation of chloride homeostasis is not completed at birth in the rat and that the upregulation of KCC2 plays a key role in the shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing IPSPs.",2020-05-02T02:14:56.011998,pubmed,6,44841706,1259625600,Developmental Up-Regulation of the Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter Type 2 in the Rat Lumbar Spinal Cord,809-21,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0306-4522,neuroscience,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,1588385696,164,1,A Stil,2,S Liabeuf,2009-12-01T00:00:00,1588385696,developmental-up-regulation-of-the-potassium-chloride-cotransporter-type-2-in-the-rat-lumbar-spinal-cord,journal-article,journal article,,pii,,S0306-4522(09)01394-3,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19699273,2020-05-02T02:14:56.011998,,,,,,,,,C Jean-Xavier,C Brocard,J-C Viemari,academic,Europe,FR,France,Amu,Aix-Marseille Université,Aix-Marseille Université Iii,aix-marseille-universite,Aix-Marseille Universite,204,1.484,academic,Europe,FR,France,Amu,Aix-Marseille Université,Aix-Marseille Université Iii,aix-marseille-universite,Aix-Marseille Universite,3,C Jean-Xavier,4,C Brocard,,,,,5,,J-C Viemari,TRUE,1078655,Céline Jean-Xavier,celine-jean-xavier,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.08.035,Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille Iii,Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille Iii,,,,,,L Vinay,,Aix-Marseille Université Ii,Aix-Marseille Université Ii,6,L Vinay,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,1078655,Céline Jean-Xavier,celine-jean-xavier,celine-jean-xavier,Université De Provence Aix-Marseille i,Paul Cézanne University Aix-Marseille Iii,Université De Provence Aix-Marseille i,Paul Cézanne University Aix-Marseille Iii,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aix-Marseille-University,University of Provence Aix-Marseille i,Aix-Marseille Université i,University of the Mediterranean Aix-Marseille Ii,Université De La Mediterranee Aix-Marseille Ii,Aix-Marseille-University,University of Provence Aix-Marseille i,Aix-Marseille Université i,University of the Mediterranean Aix-Marseille Ii,Université De La Mediterranee Aix-Marseille Ii,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hermann M Bolt,,"The carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride in humans was recognized in 1974 based on observations of hepatic angiosarcomas in highly exposed workers. A multiplicity of endpoints has been demonstrated. The primary target organ, the liver, displays differential susceptibilities of hepatocytes and sinusoidal cells, which are modified by factors of age and dose. There is consistency in organotropism between experimental animals and humans. Vinyl chloride is a pluripotent carcinogen, predominantly directed toward hepatic endothelial (sinusoidal) cells, and second toward the parenchymal cells of the liver. The similarity of results between experimental animals and humans is a solid basis of an amalgamation of experimental and epidemiological risk estimates. Vinyl chloride requires metabolic activation for carcinogenicity and mutagenicity, and toxicokinetics are a key to interpret the dose response. Practically the entire initial metabolism of vinyl chloride is oxidative. At higher exposure concentrations this is nonlinear, and metabolic saturation of metabolism in rats is reached at about 250 ppm. This is consistent with the plateau of hepatic angiosarcoma incidence in rat bioassays. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic (PBPK) models have been developed and successfully applied within the frame of human cancer risk assessments. The major DNA adduct induced by vinyl chloride (approximately 98% of total adducts in rats), 7-(2-oxoethyl)guanine, is almost devoid of promutagenic activity. The clearly promutagenic ""etheno"" adducts N2,3-ethenoguanine and 3,N4-ethenocytosine each represent approximately 1% of the vinyl chloride DNA adducts in rats, and 1,N6-ethenoadenine is found at even lower concentrations. Etheno adducts appear to have a long persistence and are repaired by glycosylases. Vinyl chloride represents a human carcinogen for which a series of mechanistic events connects exposure with the carcinogenic outcome. These include (1) metabolic activation (to form chloroethylene oxide), (2) DNA binding of the reactive metabolite (to exocyclic etheno adducts), (3) promutagenicity of these adducts, and (4) effects of such mutations on protooncogenes/tumor suppressor genes at the gene and gene product levels. In rat hepatocytes, a further event is a biomarker response. Cancer prestages (enzyme-altered foci), as quantitative biomarkers, provide a tool to study dose response even within low dose ranges where a carcinogenic risk cannot be seen in cancer bioassays directly. Such biomarker responses support a linear nonthreshold extrapolation for low-dose assessment of carcinogenic risks due to vinyl chloride. Published risk estimates based on different sets of data (animal experiments, epidemiological studies) appear basically consistent, and on this basis an angiosarcoma risk of approximately 3 x 10(-4) has been deduced by extrapolation, for exposure to 1 ppm vinyl chloride over an entire human working lifetime. An important point that should be considered in regulatory standard settings is the presence of a physiological background of those etheno DNA adducts, which are also produced by vinyl chloride. Likely reasons for this background are oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. In essence, fundamentals of the hepatocarcinogenicity of vinyl chloride appear now well established, providing a solid scientific basis for regulatory activities.",2020-05-01T17:12:43.842425,pubmed,1,41133751,,Vinyl Chloride-A Classical Industrial Toxicant of New Interest,307-23,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1040-8444,critical-reviews-in-toxicology,Crit.

R A Moss,F Zheng,"exo- and endo-2-norbornyloxychlorocarbenes (7) were generated photochemically from the corresponding diazirines (6). Both carbenes fragmented to [2-norbornyl cation (carbon monoxide) chloride] ion pairs in MeCN or 1,2-dichloroethane solutions. Products included exo-norbornyl chloride (8), endo-norbornyl chloride (9), norbornene (10), and nortricyclene (11). Fragmentation activation energies were very low (< approximately 4 kcal/mol) and, as a result, the (laser flash photolytic) rate constants for fragmentation were essentially identical for exo-7 and endo-7 ( approximately 5 x 10(5) s(-1) in MeCN). Due to chloride return within the ion pairs, product distributions from exo- and endo-7 differed, with more endo-chloride formed from the endo-carbene: the 8/9 product ratio in MeCN was approximately 41 from exo-7, but only 4.6 from endo-7. Norbornene, formed by proton transfer to Cl(-) within the ion pairs, was a major product in both cases (44% from exo-7 and 62% from endo-7). In MeOH/MeCN, up to 28% of exo-2-norbornyl methyl ether formed at the expense of some of the norbornene, but even in 100% MeOH, the norbornyl chloride products of ion pair return still accounted for 46% and 31% of the exo-7 and endo-7 product mixtures (accompanied by 26-32% of norbornene).

Catherine Loudon,Elizabeth C Davis,"Pectinate (feathery) antennae have high resistance to air flow, and therefore most of the air approaching an antenna is diverted around it and is not available for chemical sampling by the sensory hairs on that antenna. The small fraction (approximately 10-20%) of approaching air that passes through the air spaces or gaps in the antenna decelerates and the streamlines diverge as the air approaches the antenna. Sampling a small fraction of air that is decelerating and diverging has consequences for chemoreception that are described here for the first time. The behavior of the air is predicted from application of a fluid mechanical law: the principle of continuity. As this small fraction of air decelerates and flows through the air gaps in the antenna, it will be ""stretched"" in the plane perpendicular to the air flow. Therefore, the air may be sampled by the sensory hairs at a greater spatial resolution than expected from the distribution of the odorant molecules in the air upstream of the antenna. However, the slowing down of odorant-laden air as it passes through an antenna will not change the perceived temporal characteristics of the chemical stimulus (e.g., the rate of odorant filament encounter). This distortion or stretching of the air sample is expected to develop within about one antennal width upstream of the antenna, as verified by examining wakes of simple physical models.",2020-05-01T17:22:40.453385,pubmed,2,41406807,1104537600,Divergence of Streamlines Approaching a Pectinate Insect Antenna: Consequences for Chemoreception,1-13,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0098-0331,journal-of-chemical-ecology,J.

R Ilaria,D Wines,"In order to establish a routine procedure for isolating undegraded RNA from small amounts of rat and human brain tissue, several techniques were investigated. Initial studies demonstrated that undegraded RNA could not be reproducibly isolated from milligram amounts of brain tissue homogenized in an aqueous medium. Several isolation techniques utilizing tissue homogenization in the denaturing agent guanidinium chloride were compared. This method of homogenization, followed by sedimentation of RNA through cesium chloride, resulted in good yields of undegraded translationally active RNA. A maximum of 6 RNA samples could be processed simultaneously. In contrast, when homogenization in guanidinium chloride was followed by repeated guanidinium chloride-ethanol precipitations many samples could be processed simultaneously. The resulting RNA yields were low. The introduction of several modifications in the guanidinium chloride-ethanol precipitation technique resulted in a high yield of undegraded translationally active RNA. DNA was removed by two guanidinium-ethanol precipitations. Residual protein was digested with proteinase K. RNA was precipitated after extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol. This refined procedure allows the recovery, in high yields, of translationally active undegraded RNA which is both DNA and protein free.

G Nagel,T Szellas,"The genetic disease cystic fibrosis is caused by mutation of the gene coding for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Controversial studies reported regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) by CFTR. We found that uptake of (22)Na(+) through ENaC is modulated by activation of CFTR in oocytes, coexpressing CFTR and ENaC, depending on extracellular chloride concentration. Furthermore we found that the effect of CFTR activation could be mimicked by other chloride channels. Voltage- and patch-clamp measurements, however, showed neither stimulation nor inhibition of ENaC-mediated conductance by activated CFTR. We conclude that the observed modulation of (22)Na(+) uptake by activated CFTR is due to the effect of CFTR-mediated chloride conductance on the membrane potential. These findings argue against the notion of a specific influence of CFTR on ENaC and emphasize the chloride channel function of CFTR.",2020-05-01T05:32:34.269190,pubmed,5,36348168,983404800,Non-Specific Activation of the Epithelial Sodium Channel by the Cftr Chloride Channel,249-54,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1469-221X,embo-reports,EMBO Rep.,Embo Reports,1588311154,2,1,G Nagel,2,T Szellas,2001-03-01T00:00:00,1588311154,non-specific-activation-of-the-epithelial-sodium-channel-by-the-cftr-chloride-channel,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1093/embo-reports/kve045,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC1083841,2020-05-01T05:32:34.269190,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,J R Riordan,T Friedrich,K Hartung,,,,,,,,,,164,4.459,,,,,,,,,,3,J R Riordan,4,T Friedrich,,,,,5,,K Hartung,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11266369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
C R Kirby,V A Convertino,"This investigation was designed to determine the relationship between the levels of plasma aldosterone and eccrine sweat gland sodium excretion following exercise and heat acclimation. Ten subjects exercised at 45% of their maximal O2 uptake in a hot (40 degrees C), moderately humid (45% relative humidity) environment for 2 h/day on ten consecutive days. Acclimation was verified by significant reductions in exercise heart rate, rectal temperature, and heat storage, as well as significant elevation of resting plasma volume (12%, P less than 0.05) and exercise sweat rate on day 10 compared with day 1 of acclimation. During exercise, the concentration and total content of sodium in sweat as well as plasma aldosterone were significantly decreased from day 1 to day 10. The ratio of sweat sodium reabsorbed to plasma aldosterone concentration was significantly increased from day 1 to day 10 after both 1 and 2 h of exercise. These data indicate that plasma aldosterone concentrations decrease following heat acclimation; and eccrine gland responsiveness to aldosterone, as represented by sweat sodium reabsorption, may be augumented through exercise and heat acclimation.",2020-04-30T19:18:24.783340,pubmed,2,29262127,525916800,Plasma Aldosterone and Sweat Sodium Concentrations after Exercise and Heat Acclimation,967-70,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,8750-7587,journal-of-applied-physiology-bethesda-md-1985,J.

G Kargül,M Deutinger,"Different methods have been used in our department for nipple-areola reconstruction. This study was undertaken in order to find out which method of reconstruction shows optimal long-term results. Between 1983 and 1999, breast reconstruction was performed in 204 patients and different methods were used for nipple-areola reconstruction. 91 patients could be examined. For areola reconstruction full-thickness skin grafts from the groin were used as well as skin grafts from the contralateral areola, vaginal mucosal grafts, and tattoos. For nipple reconstruction we used nipple sharing, labium grafts, local flaps, and a tattoo. Areola reconstruction with full-thickness skin grafts from the groin was performed in 45 patients, in 16 patients a graft from the contralateral areola was used and in 19 patients the technique of intradermal tattoo was applied. One patient had a vaginal mucosal graft, in another patient the nipple areola complex was transplanted to the groin after mastectomy for later reconstruction. Nipple projection was measured and the colour of the reconstructed areola was compared to the other side. Concerning the match of colour, best results were achieved with grafting from the contralateral areola, followed by areola tattoo and skin grafts from the groin. The vaginal mucosal graft was too dark. The transplanted original nipple-areola complex maintained its colour. Nipple projection between 3 and 4 mm was achieved by nipple sharing and local flaps. With grafts from the labium, a projection from 1 to 2 mm was achieved. Thus, best results were achieved by nipple sharing, local flaps for nipple reconstruction and areola skin grafts from the contralateral side.

Clinical trials are now required to assess its value in the management of oral candidosis. All antimicrobials showed antifungal activity against all tested organisms, but cetylpyridinium chloride received significantly lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (P < .005). Cetylpyridinium chloride also showed a greater fungicidal activity than chlorhexidine digluconate and hexetidine (P< .005), whereas sanguinarine chloride appeared to be less fungicidal against most of the isolates tested. A broth macrodilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of 4 antimicrobial agents against Candida species. Minimum fungicidal concentration was also determined. Antimicrobial mouthrinses may represent a valid alternative to topical antifungal agents. However, the action of antimicrobials could be affected by the different ingredients incorporated into mouthrinse products. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the in vitro antifungal and fungicidal activities of antimicrobials alone.",2020-05-01T03:04:19.152903,pubmed,4,35278905,915148800,In Vitro Activities of Antimicrobial Agents against Candida Species,44-9,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,2212-4403,oral-surgery-oral-medicine-oral-pathology-oral-radiology-and-endodontics,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics",1588302259,87,1,G Giuliana,2,G Pizzo,1999-01-01T00:00:00,1588302259,in-vitro-activities-of-antimicrobial-agents-against-candida-species,journal-article,journal article,,pii,,S1079-2104(99)70293-3,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/s1079-2104(99)70293-3,2020-05-01T03:04:19.152903,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,M E Milici,R Giangreco,,academic,Europe,IT,Italy,Università Degli Studi Di Palermo,Università Degli Studi Di Palermo Facolta Di Ingegneria,University of Palermo,universita-degli-studi-di-palermo,Universita Degli Studi Di Palermo,108,0.723,academic,Europe,IT,Italy,Università Degli Studi Di Palermo,Università Degli Studi Di Palermo Facolta Di Ingegneria,University of Palermo,universita-degli-studi-di-palermo,Universita Degli Studi Di Palermo,3,M E Milici,4,R Giangreco,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9927079,University of Palermo Faculty of Engineering,University of Palermo Faculty of Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D P Wermeling,R P Rapp,"Osmolalities of commonly administered small-volume i.v. admixtures were determined, and use of diluents with lower osmolality to achieve osmolality values less than 400 mOsm/kg was studied. The theoretical osmolality of 218 hypothetical admixtures of various concentrations of 34 injectable drugs in 50- or 100-mL quantities of 5% dextrose injection or 0.9% sodium chloride injection was calculated using sodium chloride equivalents. If the calculated osmolality value was greater than 400 mOsm/kg, an actual admixture was prepared and osmolality and density were measured. To determine how admixtures with osmolality values less than 400 mOsm/kg could be prepared, theoretical osmolality was calculated using 0.45% sodium chloride injection or sterile water for injection as the diluent. The calculated osmolality value was greater than 400 mOsm/kg for 52 (23.9%) of the 218 admixtures tested. Of the 52 measured osmolality values, 47 were within 15% of the calculated value.

Here we report the iterative and integrated use of ion channel kinetic analysis and computational chemical methods in the development of high affinity blockers of the outwardly rectifying chloride channel (ORCC). Kinetic analysis, with emphasis on estimation of the block time constant as determined from critical closed time plots, was used to guide the synthesis of new disulfonic stilbene derivatives. Computational chemical methods were used to deduce the important features of the disulfonic stilbene molecule necessary for potent blockade of ORCC and ultimately led to the discovery of the calixarenes.

N M Rao,R Nagaraj,"Guanidinium chloride stimulates the activity of alkaline phosphatase from Escherichia coli, by 3-4-fold. Structural parameters of the enzyme, monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism, indicate progressive denaturation. This unusual stimulation is shown to be independent of the nature of the substrate and source of the enzyme. Profiles of pH dependence and transphosphorylation reaction indicate that the dephosphorylation step of the catalysis is enhanced in the presence of guanidinium chloride.

B Styrt,M S Klempner,"Weak bases that alkalinize the pH within neutrophil lysosomes inhibit in vitro cell functions, including lysosomal enzyme release and superoxide production. To determine the relevance of this inhibition to microbicidal activity, the effect of lysosomotropic weak bases on interactions between human neutrophils and Staphylococcus aureus 502a was studied. After treatment with 1 mM chloroquine, neutrophils showed significantly impaired phagocytosis of 14C-labeled S. aureus. However, 50 mM ammonium chloride had no effect on phagocytosis, although we have previously shown that this concentration raises lysosomal pH and inhibits degranulation and superoxide production. This base was therefore used to study effects on intracellular microbicidal activity. Incubation of neutrophils with 50 mM ammonium chloride diminished killing of S. aureus (22.9 +/- 6.3% of bacteria surviving versus 8.2 +/- 1.3% in suspensions without ammonium chloride). At 1 mM, ammonium chloride had no significant effect. The inhibition of cellular function could be neither explained as a function of neutrophil death, as measured by trypan blue dye exclusion, nor attributed to direct promotion of bacterial growth (in the absence of neutrophils, colony counts were similar in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride) or enhanced resistance to neutrophil microbicidal mechanisms (bacteria treated with ammonium chloride and washed before neutrophil exposure showed no improvement in survival). Ammonium chloride at 50 mM also impaired neutrophil killing of S. aureus in an anaerobic chamber, but microbicidal activity against Escherichia coli S15 was not affected. These findings suggest that optimal neutrophil killing of staphylococci requires a highly acid intralysosomal compartment, but ingestion of bacteria does not. This may reflect primary failure of acidification of the phagocytic vacuole or differential pH requirements for fusion of the plasma membrane with itself and with lysosome membranes. The difference between effects on killing of S. aureus and E. coli is probably a result of the relative importance of the components of neutrophil microbicidal activity against the two organisms.",2020-04-30T18:35:02.774968,pubmed,2,27967293,499651200,Modification of Interactions between Neutrophils and Staphylococci by Lysosomotropic Weak Bases,415-9,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0019-9567,infection-and-immunity,Infect.

Analysis of the amniotic fluid had shown a high chloride content, but normal concentrations of sodium, potassium, and calcium. After birth he displayed extreme polyuria, severe renal sodium and chloride loss, and marked hypercalciuria. Five weeks after birth, his sodium chloride loss turned into renal potassium loss, along with a marked decrease in urine output. All these features are characteristic of the neonatal variant of Bartter syndrome. He was discharged after 11 weeks with oral supplements of sodium chloride, potassium gluconate, and 500 ml of fluid.

Xuehua Sun,Jichuan Zhang,"The anesthetic, propofol, effectively suppresses excitatory synaptic transmission and facilitates long-term depression (LTD) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here, we have examined whether these effects are different in the developing hippocampus. We found that propofol in suppressing whole-cell excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC) was more effective in 21 day old rats than either in 7 day old rats or under the condition of high intracellular chloride concentration in 21 day old rats. Furthermore, the propofol concentration to facilitate the NMDA receptor-dependent LTD was lower at postnatal day 21 than at postnatal day 7. Interestingly, the decay time of EPSC was decreased during the development from postnatal day 7 to 21, but it was increased by the recording condition of high intracellular chloride concentration or by propofol administration. All these effects of propofol were dependent on the chloride channel opening. These observations suggest that propofol may induce differential anesthetic effects in the developing hippocampus, at least partially, depending on the intracellular chloride concentration.",2020-05-01T17:24:19.414185,pubmed,10,41452911,1118275200,Propofol Effects on Excitatory Synaptic Efficacy in the Ca1 Region of the Developing Hippocampus,1-7,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,brain-research-developmental-brain-research,Brain Res.

A F Vatta,B A Letty,"A novel clinical assay for the assessment and subsequent treatment of Haemonchus infection in sheep to slow down the development of anthelmintic resistance--the FAMACHA system--has been developed, tested and validated in South Africa. The system is based on a colour chart with five colour categories depicting varying degrees of anaemia that are compared with the colour of the mucous membranes of the eyes of sheep. The animal is then scored from severely anaemic (pale) through anaemic to non-anaemic (red) and those animals considered in danger of succumbing to the effects of haemonchosis are treated. This method was tested in goats farmed under resource-poor conditions in South Africa. Analyses in goats performed during the summers of 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 show a test sensitivity of 76 and 85%, respectively, meaning that the system may be used to identify correctly 76-85% of those animals in need of treatment with an anthelmintic. However, the test specificity remains low at 52-55%. This means that a large proportion of those animals that would not require treatment would in fact be treated. However, when the use of the FAMACHA system is compared with conventional dosing practices where all the animals are treated, using the FAMACHA system would result in a large proportion of the animals being left untreated. The untreated animals are then able to deposit the eggs of anthelmintic-susceptible worms on the pasture, while the treated ones should pass very few ova, given an effective anthelmintic. This maintains a reservoir of susceptible larvae in refugia, and should slow down the development of anthelmintic resistance. The validation of the FAMACHA system for goats for use by resource-poor farmers, which this paper describes, may have wide application in the tropics and subtropics of sub-Saharan Africa and elsewhere.",2020-05-01T05:39:25.730063,pubmed,6,36392583,996537600,Testing for Clinical Anaemia Caused by Haemonchus Spp. in Goats Farmed under Resource-Poor Conditions in South Africa using an Eye Colour Chart Developed for Sheep,1-14,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0304-4017,veterinary-parasitology,Vet.

For sliding contacts involving bare Si(3)N(4) tips, the friction coefficient is observed to increase with increasing RH, from 0% to the point of water saturation. For Si(3)N(4) tips precoated with MoS(2) particles, friction appears to be relatively insensitive to increasing RH in the range of 0-40%. However, above 40% RH, a drastic increase in friction is observed and is accompanied by evidence for interfacial wear provided in images of the basal plane following the friction measurements. A comparison to the tribological properties of the basal plane of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) using identical probe tips highlights the unique character of self-mated MoS(2) interfaces.",2020-05-02T01:58:49.069240,pubmed,2,44703133,1272672000,The Role of Water in Modifying Friction within Mos2 Sliding Interfaces,1444-8,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1944-8252,acs-applied-materials-interfaces,ACS Appl Mater Interfaces,Acs Applied Materials & Interfaces,1588384729,2,1,Xueying Zhao,2,Scott S Perry,2010-05-01T00:00:00,1588384729,the-role-of-water-in-modifying-friction-within-mos2-sliding-interfaces,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20415448,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/am100090t,2020-05-02T01:58:49.069240,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,,,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,,,,,,academic,Americas,US,United States,Uf,,,university-of-florida,University of Florida,169,2.596,academic,Americas,US,United States,Uf,,,university-of-florida,University of Florida,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P Knipschild,,In alternative health care iridology is used as a diagnostic aid. The diagnosis of gall bladder disease was used to study its validity and interperformer consistency. The presence of an inflamed gall bladder containing gall stones is said to be easily recognised by certain signs in the lower lateral part of the iris of the right eye. Stereo colour slides were made of the right eye. Stereo colour slides were made of the right eye of 39 patients with this disease and 39 control subjects of the same sex and age. The slides were presented in a random order to five leading iridologists without supplementary information. The prevalence of the disease was estimated at 56%. The median validity was 51% with 54% sensitivity and 52% specificity. These results were close to chance validity (iota = 0.03). None of the iridologists reached a high validity. The median interperformer consistency was 60%. This was only slightly higher than chance consistency (kappa = 0.18). This study showed that iridology is not a useful diagnostic aid.,2020-04-30T18:36:32.786538,pubmed,1,28010993,598320000,Looking for Gall Bladder Disease in the Patient'S Iris,1578-81,6663,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0959-8146,bmj-clinical-research-ed,BMJ,Bmj (Clinical Research Ed.),1588271792,297,1,P Knipschild,,,1988-12-17T00:00:00,1588271792,looking-for-gall-bladder-disease-in-the-patient-s-iris,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1136/bmj.297.6663.1578,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,3147081,2020-04-30T18:36:32.786538,,,,,,,,,,,,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,University of Limburg,Transnational University Limburg,,transnationale-universiteit-limburg,Transnationale Universiteit Limburg,392,2.881,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,University of Limburg,Transnational University Limburg,,transnationale-universiteit-limburg,Transnationale Universiteit Limburg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC1835305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F R Bell,S A Razig,"1. The abomasum of the milk-fed calf has been examined using an adaptation of the Serial Test Meal method devised by Hunt & Spurrell (1951). The emptying process, acid secretion and pepsin secretion were studied.2. Using serial test meals of simple solutions instilled into the abomasum via a cannula, our investigation leaves no doubt that the osmolarity of the abomasal contents significantly modifies the rate of abomasal emptying.3. Hypotonic and isotonic solutions of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate increase abomasal emptying but bicarbonate is most effective.4. Increasing the concentration of solutes in the abomasal contents slows abomasal emptying. Sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, ammonium chloride and urea do not delay abomasal emptying until hypertonic concentrations are attained. Hypotonic solutions of potassium chloride, calcium chloride, glucose, lactose, hydrochloric acid and acetic acid delay abomasal emptying.5. The results obtained in the calf show that the abomasum is under restraint probably from duodenal receptors as is the simple stomach (Hunt & Knox, 1968) and that an osmoreceptor as postulated by Hunt (1956) is an important factor in this mechanism.6. Acid secretion is inhibited when hypertonic solutions are instilled into the abomasum.7. Pepsin secretion is not affected by simple solutions in the abomasum.8. Gastric function in the milk-fed calf appears to be controlled by mechanisms essentially similar to those already demonstrated in the simple stomach.",2020-04-30T19:33:44.259434,pubmed,2,29730145,94694400,The Effect of some Molecules and Ions on Gastric Function in the Milk-Fed Calf,513-26,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-3751,the-journal-of-physiology,J.

N H Mendelson,J J Thwaites,"Engineering approaches used in the study of textile fibers have been applied to the measurement of mechanical properties of bacterial cell walls by using the Bacillus subtilis bacterial thread system. Improved methods have been developed for the production of thread and for measuring its mechanical properties. The best specimens of thread produced from cultures of strain FJ7 grown in TB medium at 20 degrees C varied in diameter by a factor of 1.09 over a 30-mm thread length. The stress-strain behavior of cell walls was determined over the range of relative humidities between 11 and 98%. Measurements of over 125 specimens indicated that cell wall behaved like other viscoelastic polymers, both natural and man-made, exhibiting relaxation under constant elongation and recovery upon load removal. This kinetic behavior and also the cell wall strength depended greatly on humidity. The recovery from extension observed after loading even up to a substantial fraction of the breaking load indicated that the properties measured were those of cell wall material rather than of behavior of the thread assemblage. Control experiments showed that neither drying of thread nor the length of time it remained dry before testing influenced the mechanical properties of the cell walls. Specimens drawn from TB medium and then washed in water and redrawn were found to be stiffer and stronger than controls not washed. However, tensile properties were not changed by exposure of cells to lysozyme before thread production. This suggests that glycan backbones are not arranged along the length of the cell cylinder. The strength of the cell wall in vivo was estimated by extrapolation to 100% relative humidity to be about 3 N/mm2. Walls of this strength would be able to bear a turgor pressure of 6 atm (ca. 607.8 kPa), but if the increase in strength of water-washed threads was appropriate, the figure could be 24 atm (ca. 2,431.2 kPa).",2020-04-30T18:31:22.360352,pubmed,2,27861275,602294400,Cell Wall Mechanical Properties as Measured with Bacterial Thread made from Bacillus Subtilis,1055-62,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0021-9193,journal-of-bacteriology,J.

B M Berardi,E Leoni,"Indoor climate indices and microbiological airborne contamination were evaluated in a department of a general hospital in Bologna only partially equipped with an air conditioning system. To determine the environmental parameters, an ANADATA (LSI) climate analyzer with relative transducers was used. The Effective Temperature (ET), the New Effective Temperature (ET*) and the Fanger indices (PMV-PPD) were calculated using the parameters measured. Microbial count measurements were taken with an S.A.S. (Surface Air System) sampler, to ascertain the total bacterial count at 37 degrees C, and the fungal particle, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa counts. Carbon dioxide air concentrations were also measured to evaluate the efficacy of air exchange. The Fanger indices were not within the range of thermal comfort in most rooms (52% in winter, 62% in summer). Air microbial counts were higher in the hospital wards and surgeries than in the offices and laboratories. In particular, coagulase-positive staphylococci were present only in the air of the patients' rooms. The microbial contamination was not correlated with the air conditioning system, but probably caused by the turnover in the hospital population, the number of people and their behaviour. However the most important measure to prevent airborne contamination and to reduce the number of microorganisms in the air is an efficient source control. Better management of the air conditioning system, by means of adequate air exchange and thermal adjustment, would lead to a notable improvement in indoor air quality, especially in units with hospitalized patients.",2020-05-01T00:21:38.960060,pubmed,2,34090534,741484800,Indoor Air Climate and Microbiological Airborne: Contamination in various Hospital Areas,405-18,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,zentralblatt-fur-hygiene-und-umweltmedizin-international-journal-of-hygiene-and-environmental-medicine,Zentralbl Hyg Umweltmed,Zentralblatt Fur Hygiene Und Umweltmedizin = International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Medicine,1588292498,194,1,B M Berardi,2,E Leoni,1993-07-01T00:00:00,1588292498,indoor-air-climate-and-microbiological-airborne-contamination-in-various-hospital-areas,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8397689,,,,,2020-05-01T00:21:38.960060,,,,,,,,,,,,academic,Europe,IT,Italy,Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna,Alma Mater Studiorum Università Di Bologna,University of Bologna,universita-di-bologna,Universita Di Bologna,,,academic,Europe,IT,Italy,Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna,Alma Mater Studiorum Università Di Bologna,University of Bologna,universita-di-bologna,Universita Di Bologna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Università Di Bologna,Università Di Bologna,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Yatagama Lokuge S Nandasena,Ananda R Wickremasinghe,"A limited number of epidemiological studies in Sri Lanka have investigated the health effects of air pollution. Based on findings of studies and reported air quality levels, air pollution may be considered a neglected public health problem in Sri Lanka. Sixteen studies investigated the association between exposure to ambient or indoor air pollution (IAP) and various health outcomes ranging from respiratory symptoms, low birth weight and lung cancers. Of the sixteen, three used a case control design. Half of the studies collected exposure data only through questionnaires. There were positive associations between air pollution and adverse health effects in all studies. Methodological limitations in most of the studies resulted in poor quantification of risk estimates. PUBMED and Medline databases, local journals and conference proceedings were searched for epidemiologic studies pertaining to air pollution and health effects in Sri Lanka. All the studies pertaining to air pollution and health effects were considered. Air pollution is increasingly documented as a threat to public health in most developing countries. Evaluation of current air quality levels, regulatory standards and scientific literature on outdoor and indoor air pollution, and health effects are important to identify the burden, develop and implement interventions and to fill knowledge gaps in Sri Lanka.",2020-05-02T02:25:55.487665,pubmed,3,44942651,1275436800,Air Pollution and Health in Sri Lanka: a Review of Epidemiologic Studies,300,,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1471-2458,bmc-public-health,BMC Public Health,Bmc Public Health,1588386355,10,1,Yatagama Lokuge S Nandasena,2,Ananda R Wickremasinghe,2010-06-02T00:00:00,1588386355,air-pollution-and-health-in-sri-lanka-a-review-of-epidemiologic-studies,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20515506,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1186/1471-2458-10-300,2020-05-02T02:25:55.487665,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,review,review,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,review,review,Nalini Sathiakumar,,,,,,,,,,,,117,1.382,,,,,,,,,,3,Nalini Sathiakumar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC2893095,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,research-support-nih-extramural,research support nih extramural,research-support-nih-extramural,research support nih extramural,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J Gailer,G N George,"Mercuric chloride toxicity in mammals can be overcome by co-administration of sodium selenite. We report a study of the mutual detoxification product in rabbit plasma, and of a Hg-Se-S-containing species synthesized by addition of equimolar mercuric chloride and sodium selenite to aqueous, buffered glutathione. Chromatographic purification of this Hg-Se-S species and subsequent structural analysis by Se and Hg extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy revealed the presence of four-coordinate Se and Hg entities separated by 2.61 A. Hg and Se near-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy of erythrocytes, plasma, and bile of rabbits that had been injected with solutions of sodium selenite and mercuric chloride showed that Hg and Se in plasma samples exhibited X-ray absorption spectra that were essentially identical to those of the synthetic Hg-Se-S species. Thus, the molecular detoxification product of sodium selenite and mercuric chloride in rabbits exhibits similarities to the synthetic Hg-Se-S species.

D Stoilova,V Koleva,"The infrared (IR) spectra of Co(HCOO)2 x 2H2O, Ni(HCOO)2 x 2H2O and Cu2Co(Ni)1-x (HCOO)2 x 2H2O mixed crystals (0 < x < or = 0.5) have been recorded and the internal modes of the formate groups and the water molecules are discussed. The analysis of the spectra of the mixed crystals reveals that when copper ions replace cobalt and nickel ions in Co(HCOO) x 2H2O and Ni(HCOO)2 x 2H2O, the Cu2+ ions are localized at the two available positions. However, the occupancy degree of the Me(1) and Me(2) sites by the different cations needs X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the single crystals. The new crystal phase Co0.17Cu0.83(HCOO)2 x 2H2O obtained from the Co(HCOO)2 x 2H2O-Cu(HCOO)2 x 2H2O-H2O system at 50 degrees C crystallizes in the monoclinic system with lattice parameters: a = 12.329(4); b = 7.241(2); c = 8.707(5) A and beta = 103.13(3) degrees (SG probably P2/c). The number of the bands corresponding to the uncoupled OD vibrations and the water librations shows that probably more than two water molecules are expected to exist in the structure.

J Graham,N Lai,"Extreme heart-rate lability accompanies the air-breathing cycles of Synbranchus marmoratus and Monopterus albus. When air is taken into the buccopharyngeal air-breathing organ of these fishes, heart rate increases sharply above pre-inspiration rates of 3&shy;25 beats min-1 to as high as 40&shy;45 beats min-1. With time, and as O2 is depleted from the air-breathing organ, heart rate gradually declines and drops to its lowest level with, or following, exhalation. Relationships between air breathing and sinus arrhythmia in M. albus were investigated by injecting variable gas volumes and O2 mixtures into the cannulated air-breathing organ. Tests were also carried out on undisturbed fish breathing volitionally in atmospheres containing different O2 levels. Both the volume and O2 content of the inspired gas affect the level and duration of inspiration tachycardia. Additional factors affecting tachycardia are the heart rate prior to inspiration and the time since air was last held. S. marmoratus is a non-obligatory air breather and uses rhythmic branchial aquatic respiration to a greater extent than M. albus, an obligate air breather. While the heart rates of both species are increased during aquatic ventilation, the higher heart rate to ventilation ratio in S. marmoratus (2&shy;3 versus approximately 1 in M. albus) seems attributable to its more proficient aquatic respiratory system. The available cardiorespiratory data for air-breathing fishes indicate that the scope of air-inspiration tachycardia is smaller in lungfishes and other primitive species than in most teleosts. This difference is mainly attributable to the greater chronotropic effect of sympathetic cardiac innervation in teleosts.",2020-05-01T02:41:24.310606,pubmed,4,35091897,788918400,The Transition to Air Breathing in Fishes.

Glen P Kenny,Daniel Gagnon,"This study compared the effect of active, passive, and inactive recoveries on whole body evaporative and dry heat loss responses during intermittent exercise at an air temperature of 30 degrees C and a relative humidity of 20%. Nine males performed three 15-min bouts of upright seated cycling at a fixed external workload of 150 W. The exercise bouts were separated by three 15-min recoveries during which participants 1) performed loadless pedaling (active recovery), 2) had their lower limbs passively compressed with inflatable sleeves (passive recovery), or 3) remained upright seated on the cycle ergometer (inactive recovery). Combined direct and indirect calorimetry was employed to measure rates of whole body evaporative heat loss (EHL) and metabolic heat production (M-W). Mean body temperature (T(b)) was calculated from esophageal and mean skin temperatures, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was measured continuously. Active and passive recoveries both reversed the reduction in MAP associated with inactive recovery (P <or= 0.05). This response was paralleled by greater levels of EHL during active (207 +/- 53 W) and passive recoveries (203 +/- 55 W) compared with the inactive condition (168 +/- 53 W, P <or= 0.05). However, the greater rate of EHL during active recovery was paralleled by a greater M-W (194 +/- 16 W) compared with inactive recovery (149 +/- 27 W, P <or= 0.001). In contrast, M-W during passive recovery (139 +/- 20 W) was not significantly different from the inactive condition (P = 0.468). Furthermore, there were no differences in T(b) between inactive and passive conditions during the recovery periods (P = 0.820). As such, passive recovery resulted in greater levels of EHL for a given change in T(b) compared with inactive recovery (P <or= 0.05). These results strongly suggest that the progressive increase in core temperature during successive exercise/rest cycles is primarily the result of a baroreflex-mediated attenuation of postexercise whole body evaporative heat loss.",2020-05-02T01:49:39.503863,pubmed,2,44616866,1277942400,Is there Evidence for Nonthermal Modulation of whole Body Heat Loss during Intermittent Exercise,R119-28,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0363-6119,american-journal-of-physiology-regulatory-integrative-and-comparative-physiology,Am.

H Van Cuyck-Gandre,G Moulin,"Susceptibility to chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride and mercury chloride was studied for 70 Gram negative strains (56 Enterobacteriaceae and 14 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) recovered from humans or animals. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined on solid agar (replica plating) and in a liquid medium (laser nephelometry). For resistant strains, plasmidic mediation was looked for using conjugation. Isolation of lysates by the miniprep analytic method and physicochemical characterization of plasmids by agar electrophoresis were carried out using conjugative strains. MICs obtained using the two methods differed by one dilution at the most. Both methods yielded reproducible results. Regardless of the origin of strains, a resistant population was identified only for mercury chloride.

A Pönkä,M Virtanen,"The effects of low levels of air pollution and weather conditions on the number of patients admitted to hospitals for exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or emphysema (n = 2807) was studied in Helsinki during a 3-year period, 1987-1989. The daily number of admissions via the emergency room was significantly associated with prevailing levels of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in Poisson regressions controlled for weather, season, time trends, and day of the week, whereas the total number of admissions (via the emergency room and otherwise) was not significantly associated with these pollutants. The effect of SO2 was observed only among those under 65 years old; a significant peak of admissions was seen during the same day (RR, 1.31 for a 2.7-fold increase in SO2; 95% CI, 1.01-1.70; P = 0.039), and another after a 3-day lag (RR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05-1.86; P = 0.021). The effect of NO2 was strongest after a 6-day lag and was significant only among those over 64 years old (RR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03-1.66; P = 0.022). The average of mean 24-hr concentrations of NO2 was 39 micrograms/m3 (0.021 ppm) and that for SO2 was 19 micrograms/m3 (0.0067 ppm). No relationship was found between admissions and the concentrations of total suspended particulates (TSP) or ozone (O3), the temperature, or the relative humidity. However, the number of admissions among those over 64 years of age was significantly lower, irrespective of temperature, during the summer than during other seasons. The mean daily concentration of O3 was fairly low (22 micrograms/m3 or 0.011 ppm), but that of TSP was high, 76 micrograms/m3. the mean temperature was low, +4.7 degrees C. These results suggest that SO2 and NO2 concentrations lower than those given as guidelines in many countries, and lower than previously shown, may increase the incidence of symptoms in some patients with chronic bronchitis or emphysema.",2020-05-01T00:01:00.594626,pubmed,2,33938472,767750400,"Chronic Bronchitis, Emphysema, and Low-Level Air Pollution in Helsinki, 1987-1989",207-17,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0013-9351,environmental-research,Environ.

During hypoxic exposure red cell water content, sodium and chloride concentration and pH increased, whereas plasma sodium and chloride concentrations decreased. Treatment of the animals with a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol, before the onset of hypoxia, largely inhibited the increase in red cell water content, diminished the changes in red cell pH and prevented the changes in red cell and plasma sodium concentration. The red cell chloride concentration increased also in propranolol-treated animals thus illustrating the effect of the deoxygenation of haemoglobin on the ion concentrations of red cells.

We observed the pulse splitting and the enhancement of the pulse broadening due to the 100-m propagation in air. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis by use of the HITRAN database at the edge and the center of the water-vapor absorption regions in air. Measured autocorrelation traces are mostly reproduced by those calculated with only the real part (dispersion) of the refractive index modulated by water-vapor absorption lines in air. This fact enables us to conclude that the pulse deformations due to water absorption lines in air are caused mainly by the real part (dispersion), not by the imaginary part (absorption), of the refractive index of air.",2020-05-01T17:10:27.474728,pubmed,4,41074726,1097366400,Measurements and Numerical Analysis for Femtosecond Pulse Deformations after Propagation of Hundreds of Meters in Air with Water-Vapor Absorption Lines,5523-30,29,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1559-128X,applied-optics,Appl Opt,Applied Optics,1588353027,43,1,Yoshihisa Yamaoka,2,Lijiang Zeng,2004-10-10T00:00:00,1588353027,measurements-and-numerical-analysis-for-femtosecond-pulse-deformations-after-propagation-of-hundreds-of-meters-in-air-with-water-vapor-absorption-lines,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1364/ao.43.005523,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15508610,2020-05-01T17:10:27.474728,,,,,,,,,Kaoru Minoshima,Hirokazu Matsumoto,,,,,,,,,,,175,0.749,,,,,,,,,,3,Kaoru Minoshima,4,Hirokazu Matsumoto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Y Yang,J Nair,"Etheno adducts in DNA bases are formed from exogenous agents such as vinyl chloride and urethane, but also via endogenous lipid peroxidation products like trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. An immunohistochemical method was developed to localize the promutagenic 1,N(6)-ethenodeoxyadenosine DNA adduct in liver of rats exposed to vinyl chloride or an iron overload with or without carbon tetrachloride. Six monoclonal antibodies, previously produced through collaborative efforts, were screened for their optimal adduct recognition and low background formation. The antibody generated by clone EM-A-4 was found to be most suitable. Semi-quantitative image analysis of relative pixel intensity showed approximately 1.5 times higher adduct levels (P < 0.05) in the livers of rats treated with vinyl chloride or an iron overload when compared with untreated controls. Significantly elevated adduct levels persisted in vinyl chloride-treated rat liver 14 days after cessation of exposure, suggesting that this adduct is not rapidly eliminated from rat liver DNA.

A J Bezuidenhout,H B Groenewald,"An accurate description of the number, location and relative position of the air sacs and their diverticula in the ostrich is essential for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of air sacculitis in this bird. The air sacs were studied in ten ostriches of varying ages by latex or silicone casting of the respiratory tract and dissection. Results revealed that the air sacs of the ostrich conform to the general pattern in birds. Cervical, lateral and medial clavicular, cranial and caudal thoracic, and abdominal air sacs are present. The left and right medial clavicular air sacs fuse with each other ventrally to the trachea to form a single, median compartment. A unique, large gastric diverticulum which covers the caudal aspects of the proventriculus and gizzard originates from the median compartment of the clavicular air sac. The lateral clavicular air sacs and their diverticula are similar to those of other bird species, with the exception that humeral diverticula are absent. Both abdominal air sacs are relatively small, with the left sac being the larger. Perirenal and femoral diverticula, similar to those found in other bird species, are present. However, the entire femur is aerated by the femoral diverticulum which also forms a large, subcutaneous division caudally and caudo-laterally to the femur. The presence of this subcutaneous part has practical implications for injury and intramuscular injections. The number and location of ostia connecting the air sacs to the bronchial tree are generally similar to those reported in other bird species.",2020-05-01T05:41:25.011046,pubmed,3,36404877,944006400,An Anatomical Study of the Respiratory Air Sacs in Ostriches,317-25,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-onderstepoort-journal-of-veterinary-research,Onderstepoort J.

T Büttner,W Kuhn,"Recently distorted chromatic contour perception has been demonstrated in Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of our study is to determine the clinical factors which influence chromatic contour perception in PD. Chromatic and achromatic contour perception, colour discrimination and clinical data were evaluated in 73 patients with PD. We used a computer-aided method to determine the chromatic fusion time (CFT) which indicates the acuity of monochromatic contour perception. Chromatic CFT was generally shortened in patients as compared to controls (p < 0.01), whereas achromatic CFT was not significantly different. Variance analysis revealed the ability of colour discrimination and the risk of visual hallucinations as statistically significant (p < 0.05) variables influencing contour perception of certain stimuli. In contrast, disease stage, disease duration and disease severity have no relevant effect on chromatic contour perception in Parkinson's disease. On the basis of those properties one may suggest that distorted chromatic contour perception is due to an impairment at a central stage of visual processing in PD and an imbalance of the serotonergic system. Whether CFT is a reliable method to predict the individual risk of hallucinosis in PD has to be evaluated.",2020-05-01T00:23:33.905659,pubmed,7,34105150,820454400,Visual Hallucinosis: the Major Clinical Determinant of Distorted Chromatic Contour Perception in Parkinson'S Disease,1195-204,10,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0300-9564,journal-of-neural-transmission-vienna-austria-1996,J Neural Transm (Vienna),"Journal of Neural Transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",1588292613,103,1,T Büttner,2,W Kuhn,1996-01-01T00:00:00,1588292613,visual-hallucinosis-the-major-clinical-determinant-of-distorted-chromatic-contour-perception-in-parkinson-s-disease,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9013406,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/bf01271204,2020-05-01T00:23:33.905659,,,,,,,,,T Müller,F L Welter,J Federlein,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,Ruhr University Bochum,Ruhr-Universität Bochum,,ruhr-universitat-bochum,Ruhr-Universitat Bochum,100,1.052,academic,Europe,DE,Germany,Ruhr University Bochum,Ruhr-Universität Bochum,,ruhr-universitat-bochum,Ruhr-Universitat Bochum,3,T Müller,4,F L Welter,,,,,5,,J Federlein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,K Heidbrink,H Przuntek,,,6,K Heidbrink,7,H Przuntek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
K T Seow,J M Lingard,"Acinar secretion was studied in the caerulein-stimulated perfused rat pancreas. Unstimulated glands secreted at a mean basal rate of 1.1 microliters X g-1 X min-1 (SD = 0.74), which was not altered by perfusate anion substitution or by transport-blocking drugs. Caerulein evoked a maximum response (6.8 microliter X g-1 X min-1, SE = 0.36, n = 8) at a concentration of 18 pmol/l. Replacement of perfusate bicarbonate with either chloride or acetate did not significantly alter the stimulated secretory rate. In contrast, replacement with acetate of either chloride alone or chloride and bicarbonate reduced the rate of stimulated secretion by 75-80%, and replacement with isethionate abolished the response altogether. In glands perfused with solutions containing chloride but not bicarbonate, furosemide (10(-5) M), 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS, 10(-4) M), amiloride (10(-4) M), and methazolamide (10(-4) M) all reduced the secretory response by more than 70%. When bicarbonate was included in the perfusate, the inhibitory effects for the same doses of blockers were much less, and except for methazolamide the same level of maximum inhibition was obtained when the blocker doses were increased 10-fold. The results suggest that rat pancreatic acini utilize a different secretory mechanism from the sodium chloride-carrying symport postulated to be most important in rat mandibular glands. The simplest model to explain our results would involve paired, basolateral antiports for Na-H and Cl-HCO3 exchange. We cannot exclude the presence of a Na-Cl symport, but if present, its role appears to be minor.",2020-04-30T19:37:12.235635,pubmed,3,29842956,507600000,Anionic Basis of Fluid Secretion by Rat Pancreatic Acini in Vitro,G140-8,2 Pt 1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-american-journal-of-physiology,Am.

R J Massie,B Wilcken,"The excess of DeltaF508 heterozygotes detected by IRT/DNA screening is associated with the presence of a second mutation or the 5T allele in some infants. Screened infants with borderline sweat chloride levels almost certainly have CF, but long-term follow-up of the infants with the genotype DeltaF508/R117H and DeltaF508/5T is required to determine their outcome. In the meantime, newborn screening should be confined to severe mutations associated with classic CF. Over a 24-month period we identified 122 DeltaF508 heterozygotes and recruited 57; 4 had borderline sweat chloride levels (40 to 60 mmol/L), 5 (8.8%, 95% CI 1.4, 16.2) had a second CF mutation (R117H), and 11 (20%, 95% CI 10, 30) had the intron 8 5T allele. Three had clinical CF at 12 months (initial sweat chloride levels: 53, 51, and 32 mmol/L). Pancreatic electrolyte secretion in the subjects with a borderline sweat chloride level was similar to that in patients with known CF. Infants identified by newborn screening with an elevated IRT level, one DeltaF508 allele, and a sweat chloride level <60 mmol/L underwent CF mutation analysis, pancreatic stimulation testing, and repeat IRT analysis followed by clinical review and repeat sweat test at 12 months. Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) with immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) and DeltaF508 analysis followed by sweat testing misses some infants with CF and detects more DeltaF508 carriers than expected. Some of the apparent DeltaF508 carriers may be DeltaF508 compound heterozygotes with normal sweat electrolyte levels.",2020-05-01T05:37:57.762492,pubmed,7,36382934,965088000,Pancreatic Function and Extended Mutation Analysis in Deltaf508 Heterozygous Infants with an Elevated Immunoreactive Trypsinogen but Normal Sweat Electrolyte Levels,214-20,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-3476,the-journal-of-pediatrics,J.

P W Singleton,C Van Kessel,"Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr. cv Davis) was grown in a split-root growth system designed to maintain control of the root atmosphere. Two experiments were conducted to examine how 80% Ar:20% O(2) (Ar:O(2)) and air (Air) atmospheres affected N assimilation (NH(4)NO(3) and N(2) fixation) and the partitioning of photosynthate to roots and nodules. Application of NH(4)NO(3) to nonnodulated half-root systems enhanced root growth and root respiration at the site of application. A second experiment applied Ar:O(2) or air to the two sides of nodulated soybean half-root systems for 11 days in the following combinations: (a) Air to both sides (Air/Air); (b) Air to one side, Ar:O(2) to the other (Air/Ar:O(2)), and (c) Ar:O(2) to both sides (Ar:O(2)/Ar:O(2)). Results indicated that dry matter and current photosynthate ((14)C) were selectively partitioned to nodules and roots where N(2) was available. Both root and nodule growth on the Air side of Air/Ar:O(2) plants was significantly greater than the Ar:O(2) side. The relative partitioning of carbon and current photosynthate between roots and nodules on a half-root system was also affected by N(2) availability. The Ar:O(2) sides partitioned relatively more current photosynthate to roots (57%) than nodules (43%), while N(2)-fixing root systems partitioned 36 and 64% of the carbon to roots and nodules, respectively. The Ar:O(2) atmosphere decreased root and nodule respiration by 80% and nitrogenase activity by 85% compared to half-root systems in Air while specific nitrogenase activity of nodules in Ar:O(2) was 50% of nodules supplied Air. Results indicated that nitrogen assimilation, whether from N(2) fixation or inorganic sources, had a localized effect on root development. Nodule development accounted for the major decrease in total photosynthate partitioning to non-N(2)-fixing nodules. Soybean compensates for ineffective nodulation by controlling the flux of carbon to ineffective nodules and their associated roots.",2020-05-01T17:22:47.055523,pubmed,2,41409696,541555200,Effect of Localized Nitrogen Availability to Soybean Half-Root Systems on Photosynthate Partitioning to Roots and Nodules,552-6,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0032-0889,plant-physiology,Plant Physiol.,Plant Physiology,1588353767,83,1,P W Singleton,2,C Van Kessel,1987-03-01T00:00:00,1588353767,effect-of-localized-nitrogen-availability-to-soybean-half-root-systems-on-photosynthate-partitioning-to-roots-and-nodules,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC1056403,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,16665287,2020-05-01T17:22:47.055523,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,276,3.71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1104/pp.83.3.552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As there is no information on the long-term changes of the surface hardness in this respect, the aim of this study was to determine these long-term changes in 10 conventionally setting glass ionomer formulations after storage in water as compared to maturation in a humid atmosphere (85% RH). After setting for 15 min different series of glass ionomer specimens were stored at 37 degrees C in both experimental media for 1, 7, 28 and 140 days. At the end of the specific maturation times, the mean surface hardness was determined on the basis of Knoop Hardness (KHN). Data were analyzed using ANOVA. In a humid atmosphere the surface hardness generally increases rapidly initially, followed after 1 day by a more gradual increase. In contact with water, the hardness also increases up to one day but not to the same extent. The surface hardness then remains constant or slightly decreases. Evidence of a detrimental softening of the surface ascribed previously to the loss of matrix forming ions was not found.

M A Flory,S K Mclamarrah,"The pure rotational spectrum of CoS, the cobalt sulfide radical, has been measured using direct absorption techniques in the frequency range of 180-540 GHz. This study is the first spectroscopic investigation of any kind of this molecule. CoS was created by reacting cobalt vapor with H2S. Four spin components were identified in the spectra of this species, one of which exhibited lambda doubling, identifying the ground state as 4Deltai. Transitions arising from the lowest spin component of the less abundant Co 35S isotopomer have also been detected, as well as from v=1 and v=2 of the main species. The spectra were readily identified because each spin component exhibited an octet pattern arising from the 59Co spin of I=72. The data were fit using Hund's case (a) Hamiltonian, and rotational, fine-structure, hyperfine, and lambda-doubling constants were determined. The hyperfine parameters support a delta3pi2 electron configuration and are consistent with some orbital overlap between the metal and sulfur atoms. From the rotational constant, the bond length of CoS was calculated to be r0=1.977 985 06(10) A. This bond length is significantly shorter than that of MnS or FeS, in contrast to the bond distances found in the oxide analogs which are all similar in value. These results indicate that the 3d metal sulfides differ somewhat from their oxide counterparts, probably due to the availability of sulfur p orbitals for bonding.",2020-05-01T17:18:33.178368,pubmed,3,41289205,1129939200,High-Resolution Spectroscopy of Cos (X4Deltai): Examining 3D Transition-Metal Sulfide Bonds,164312,16,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0021-9606,the-journal-of-chemical-physics,J Chem Phys,The Journal of Chemical Physics,1588353513,123,1,M A Flory,2,S K Mclamarrah,2005-10-22T00:00:00,1588353513,high-resolution-spectroscopy-of-cos-x4deltai-examining-3d-transition-metal-sulfide-bonds,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,16268702,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1063/1.2083507,2020-05-01T17:18:33.178368,,,,,,,,,L M Ziurys,,,academic,Americas,US,United States,The University of Arizona Outreach College,The Ua,,the-university-of-arizona,The University of Arizona,314,1.159,academic,Americas,US,United States,The University of Arizona Outreach College,The Ua,,the-university-of-arizona,The University of Arizona,3,L M Ziurys,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimates were independent of leaf temperature, for which mean values were indirectly determined. The approach involved the measurement, at steady-state conditions, of the net change in water vapor flux per unit of leaf surface (Deltaq(v)) in response to a small induced change in absolute humidity (DeltaC(a)). Assuming that total leaf resistance (r(l)) was constant and that change in leaf temperature (T(l)) was negligible, total leaf resistance was calculated from the equation, [Formula: see text]While the assumptions concerning r(l) and T(l) may or may not be correct, evidence is presented which indicates that such assumptions did not significantly alter estimates of r(l) from their true values for changes in ambient relative humidity ranging from 0.011 to 0.074. Total leaf resistance of groups of whole plants estimated in this manner did not differ for ambient temperatures of 17, 25, and 33 C. Mean values of r(l) ranged from 83 sec cm(-1) in darkness to 2.4 sec cm(-1) at an illumination of 12.8 klux.",2020-05-01T17:19:25.015377,pubmed,2,41314426,255139200,Estimation of Whole-Plant Resistance to Gaseous Exchange Independent of Leaf Temperature Measurement,231-5,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0032-0889,plant-physiology,Plant Physiol.,Plant Physiology,1588353565,61,1,C L Browne,2,S C Fang,1978-02-01T00:00:00,1588353565,estimation-of-whole-plant-resistance-to-gaseous-exchange-independent-of-leaf-temperature-measurement,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC1091838,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,16660266,2020-05-01T17:19:25.015377,,,,,,,,,,,,academic,Americas,US,United States,Osu,Oregon Agricultural College,,oregon-state-university,Oregon State University,276,3.71,academic,Americas,US,United States,Osu,Oregon Agricultural College,,oregon-state-university,Oregon State University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1104/pp.61.2.231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J E Cone,D Shusterman,"People assess the quality of the air indoors primarily on the basis of its odors and on their perception of associated health risk. The major current contributors to indoor odorants are human occupant odors (body odor), environmental tobacco smoke, volatile building materials, bio-odorants (particularly mold and animal-derived materials), air fresheners, deodorants, and perfumes. These are most often present as complex mixtures, making measurement of the total odorant problem difficult. There is no current method of measuring human body odor, other than by human panel studies of expert judges of air quality. Human body odors have been quantitated in terms of the ""olf"" which is the amount of air pollution produced by the average person. Another quantitative unit of odorants is the ""decipol,"" which is the perceived level of pollution produced by the average human ventilated by 10 L/sec of unpolluted air or its equivalent level of dissatisfaction from nonhuman air pollutants. The standard regulatory approach, focusing on individual constituents or chemicals, is not likely to be successful in adequately controlling odorants in indoor air. Besides the current approach of setting minimum ventilation standards to prevent health effects due to indoor air pollution, a standard based on the olf or decipol unit might be more efficacious as well as simpler to measure.",2020-04-30T18:25:25.390635,pubmed,2,27690317,688953600,Health Effects of Indoor Odorants,53-9,,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0091-6765,environmental-health-perspectives,Environ.

Bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide was the most potent inhibitor of both ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation, and it was the only organotin that directly induced aggregation. It also increased the latent period for induction of aggregation by collagen. Triphenyltin hydroxide was a weak inhibitor of both ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation. However, in contrast to bis(tri-n-butyltin)oxide, it decreased the latent period for collagen-induced aggregation. A similar effect also was observed with diphenyltin dichloride, phenyltin trichloride, and cyhexatin.

S D Lidofsky,R M Roman,"Cells involved in the retrieval and metabolic conversion of amino acids undergo significant increases in size in response to amino acid uptake. The resultant adaptive responses to cell swelling are thought to include increases in membrane K+ and Cl- permeability through activation of volume-sensitive ion channels. This viewpoint is largely based on experimental models of hypotonic swelling, but few mammalian cells experience hypotonic challenge in vivo. Here we have examined volume regulatory responses in a physiological model of cell-swelling alanine uptake in immortalized hepatocytes. Alanine-induced cell swelling was followed by a decrease in cell volume that was temporally associated with an increase in membrane Cl- currents. These currents were dependent both on alanine concentration and Na+, suggesting that currents were stimulated by Na+-coupled alanine uptake. Cl- currents were outwardly rectifying, exhibited an anion permeability sequence of I- > Br- > Cl-, and were inhibited by the Cl- channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, features similar to those reported for a widely distributed class of volume-sensitive anion channels evoked by experimental hypotonic stress. These findings suggest that volume-sensitive anion channels participate in adaptive responses to amino acid uptake and provide such channels with a new physiological context.",2020-05-01T02:56:20.349998,pubmed,2,35211895,875664000,Alanine Uptake Activates Hepatocellular Chloride Channels,G849-53,4,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,the-american-journal-of-physiology,Am.

Benedict W Wheeler,Yoav Ben-Shlomo,"Further evidence of environmental inequity in the UK is provided. The association between FEV1 and local air quality is of similar magnitude to that with social class, and the adverse effects of air pollution seem to be greater in men in lower social classes. Urban lower social class households were more likely to be located in areas of poor air quality, but the association in rural areas was, if anything reversed. Low social class and poor air quality were independently associated with decreased lung function (FEV1), but not asthma prevalence, after adjustment for a number of potential confounders. Social class effects were not attenuated by adjustment for air quality. In men, a differential effect of air pollution on FEV1 was found, with its effect in social classes III to V about double that in social classes I and II (p value for interaction = 0.04). This effect modification was not seen for women. Participants aged 16-79 in the Health Survey for England 1995, 1996, and 1997. Data on people taking part in the Health Survey for England were attributed with a small area index of air pollution using annual mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, benzene, and particulates (PM10).

Krzysztof Milewski,Aleksander Zurakowski,"Despite thinner struts, CoCr stents have no advantage over stainless steel stents in terms of neointimal hyperplasia inhibition. However, their positive safety results together with their high radial strength, low profile, and excellent elasticity can ensure their usage, especially in lesions of complex morphology. Quantitative coronary angiography and histomorphometric analysis revealed no statistically significant difference between the two groups of stents. However, there was a trend toward greater late lumen loss (p=0.09) and neointimal area in the CoCr stents (p=0.08). The qualitative histopathology of the CoCr stents revealed findings typical of bare metal stents reviewed in the literature and approved for use in clinical practice. No signs of stent thrombosis, necrosis, or fibrin deposits were observed nor signs of excessive inflammatory reaction. Endothelialization was complete within 28 days. Eighteen stents were implanted into the coronary arteries of nine pigs. Control coronarography was performed 28 days after stent implantation. The animals were then sacrificed, their hearts explanted, and the coronary arteries isolated for further histopathological analysis. The high radial force and durability of cobalt-chromium alloy enable the construction of low-profile stents with thin struts, which improves their elasticity and may play a key role in reducing the incidence of neointimal hyperplasia as well as allow faster endothelialization.

J M Mcgreevy,R G Barton,"Omeprazole uncouples histamine-stimulated hydrogen and chloride secretion in the frog gastric mucosa. This uncoupling results in a large increase in PD and Isc due to the unmasking of an electrogenic Cl- flux. Using a selective anoxia technique, we have attempted to define the cellular origin of this electrogenic Cl- flux. Sixteen bullfrog gastric mucosae were mounted in Ussing chambers. Under short-circuit conditions, PD, Isc, R, and unidirectional 36Cl flux were determined every 15 min. Acid secretion (10(-5) M histamine) was measured by hand titration (0.1 N NaOH). With both sides of the mucosae oxygenated, the addition of omeprazole (10(-4) M) resulted in cessation of H+ secretion and the unveiling of an electrogenic Cl- flux. Subsequent serosal anoxia (5% CO2-95% N2 nutrient side/30% O2 secretory side) resulted in a drop in JClnet associated with an appropriate fall in Isc. These changes were reversible with reoxygenation: (Table: see text). Bullfrog gastric mucosae which are partially oxygenated on the secretory side only (serosal anoxia) do not secrete acid in response to histamine. Therefore, the JClnet which is inhibited in these experiments by serosal anoxia may originate in the gastric glands approximately equal to 3.0 mu eq/cm2 X hr). The JClnet which remains during serosal anoxia may originate in the surface epithelial cells (approximately equal to 1.0 mu eq/cm2 X hr).",2020-04-30T18:49:06.440579,pubmed,3,28385136,515289600,Chloride Transport in Bullfrog Gastric Mucosa,462-6,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-4804,the-journal-of-surgical-research,J.

The calculated results indicate that the PCSs with hexagonal or triangular air holes have enough large photonic band gaps in the guided mode spectrum, hence they are good candidates to be used for the PC devices. The PCs with hexagonal or triangular air holes were fabricated successfully on n-type GaAs (111)B substrate by selective-area metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (SA-MOVPE). Vertical and smooth facets are formed and the uniformities are very good. The same process was also used to fabricate hexagonal air hole arrays with the width of 100 nm successfully. A procedure was proposed and utilized to fabricate the air-bridge PCS with normal hexagonal air holes. The fabricated hexagonal air holes are very uniform and the sidewalls are smooth and vertical.

A Diaz-Arnold,J C Keller,"Results of this study suggest differences in oxide composition and thickness due to various surface treatments. Furnace oxidation did not significantly affect bond strength and may not be required as a separate step for metal preparation if a resin adhesive is used. Furnace oxidation brought Be to the surface and increased the oxide thickness. Air abrasion removed the oxide layer and resulted in surfaces containing significant amounts of Al2O3. Bond strengths for Group 0 were significantly lower than bond strengths for Groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, but not significantly different from bond strengths for Groups 2 and 7 (p<0.05). Cylinders of Ni-Cr-Be (Rexillium III, Jeneric/Pentron) were cast and the following test groups were investigated: Group 0: no furnace oxidation, no air abrasion; Group 1: air fired, starting temperature 650 degrees C, ending temperature 1000 degrees C (1 min hold); Group 2: same firing sequence under vacuum; Group 3: same air firing sequence followed by air abrasion with 50 micrometers Al2O3; Group 4: vacuum fired, air abraded with 50 micrometers Al2O3; Group 5: air fired, air abraded with 280 micrometers Al2O3; Group 6: vacuum fired, air abraded with 280 micrometers Al2O3; Group 7: no furnace oxidation, air abraded with 50 micrometers Al2O3; and Group 8: no furnace oxidation, air abraded with 280 micrometers Al2O3. The oxide composition of three cylinders per group was analyzed with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). Twenty cylinders from each group were bonded together with Panavia 21 (Kuraray), stored in water for 30 d, and tensile tested. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Duncan's Multiple-Range test (p=0.05). Since resin composite cements adhere directly to base metal surfaces, the composition and integrity of the surface oxide layer is considered critical for adequate bonding. The aims of this study were to determine the tensile bond strength, and assess predominant surface oxides and oxide layer depth on the surface of a Ni-Cr-Be alloy after subjecting the alloy to various surface treatments.",2020-05-01T00:18:25.987716,pubmed,4,34067244,820454400,Bond Strength and Surface Characterization of a Ni-Cr-Be Alloy,58-63,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0109-5641,dental-materials-official-publication-of-the-academy-of-dental-materials,Dent Mater,Dental Materials : Official Publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,1588292305,12,1,A Diaz-Arnold,2,J C Keller,1996-01-01T00:00:00,1588292305,bond-strength-and-surface-characterization-of-a-ni-cr-be-alloy,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/s0109-5641(96)80065-0,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8598252,2020-05-01T00:18:25.987716,comparative-study,comparative study,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,comparative-study,comparative study,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,J P Wightman,V D Williams,,academic,Americas,US,United States,,,,the-university-of-iowa,The University of Iowa,132,1.938,academic,Americas,US,United States,,,,the-university-of-iowa,The University of Iowa,3,J P Wightman,4,V D Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,pii,,S0109-5641(96)80011-X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M S Harris,J W Dobbins,"Studies in intact animals have shown that intestinal solute absorption is enhanced with increasing flow rates; the mechanism of this phenomenon has not been explored in detail. We used single pass perfusions of rat ileum to study the effect of higher flow rate on electrolyte absorption. Augmenting perfusion rate from 0.5 to 5.0 ml/min resulted in increased rates of sodium (11.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 23.5 +/- 2.7 mueq/min X g) and chloride (12.1 +/- 0.8 vs. 25.0 +/- 2.2 mueq/min X g) absorption, reduction in the estimated unstirred layer thickness (668 +/- 31 vs. 433 +/- 28 micron), minimal changes in intraluminal pressure and transmural potential difference, and a small, though significant, increase in intraluminal volume (19.4 +/- 8.4%). Removal of sodium from the perfusion medium abolished the effect of increased flow rate on chloride absorption as did removal of chloride on sodium absorption; addition of furosemide or acetazolamide to Ringer's solution also inhibited this effect. In separate experiments, stepwise increases in intraluminal volume were induced by elevating the outflow tubing; no effect on electrolyte transport was observed. These studies demonstrate that neutral sodium chloride absorption is enhanced in rat ileum at higher flow rates, perhaps as a result of a decrease in the thickness of unstirred layers.",2020-04-30T19:21:51.169624,pubmed,3,29368530,523238400,Augmentation of Neutral Sodium Chloride Absorption by Increased Flow Rate in Rat Ileum in Vivo,431-8,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0021-9738,the-journal-of-clinical-investigation,J.

M Sahebgharani,S P Hardy,Eliminating the ability of tamoxifen to cross the plasma membrane abolishes its channel blocking activity against volume activated chloride channels in HeLa cells. Extracellular tamoxifen at 3 microM inhibited volume activated chloride currents in HeLa cells whereas EBT had no effect up to 10 microM when applied either to the extracellular bathing solution or the intracellular solution via the patch pipette. Volume activated chloride currents were recorded from single HeLa cells using whole cell patch clamp technique. The ability of tamoxifen and its membrane impermeant quaternary derivative ethyl bromide tamoxifen (EBT) to inhibit these currents was examined. Tamoxifen has been shown to inhibit volume activated chloride currents in many cell types. Tamoxifen has also been reported to inhibit a number of cation channels as well as cytosolic proteins such as calmodulin. The mechanism of channel block by tamoxifen is not known but three hypotheses can be proposed: i) a direct effect following binding to the channel protein from the aqueous environment or ii) a direct effect on the channel protein after partitioning into the lipid membrane or iii) an indirect mechanism via binding to intracellular regulatory proteins after diffusion across the lipid membrane. The aim of these experiments was to distinguish between these hypotheses using membrane permeant and impermeant antioestrogens.,2020-05-01T06:25:49.357088,pubmed,5,36698507,978307200,Volume--Activated Chloride Currents in Hela Cells are Blocked by Tamoxifen but not by a Membrane Impermeant Quaternary Analogue,99-104,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1015-8987,cellular-physiology-and-biochemistry-international-journal-of-experimental-cellular-physiology-biochemistry-and-pharmacology,Cell.

Daisuke Koyama,Yuji Wada,"An ultrasonic air pump that uses a traveling wave along a small air gap between a bending vibrator and a reflector is discussed. The authors investigate ultrasonic air pumps that make use of bending vibrators and reflectors and confirm that air can be induced to flow by generating an asymmetric acoustic standing wave along an air gap. In this paper, we proposed a novel ultrasonic air pump in which a traveling wave along an air gap induces acoustic streaming and achieves one-way airflow. Two new reflector configurations, stepped and tapered, were designed and used to generate traveling waves. To predict airflow generation, sound pressure distribution in the air gap was calculated by means of finite element analysis (FEA). As a preliminary step, 2 FEA models were compared: one piezoelectric-structure-acoustic model and one piezoelectric- structure-fluid model, which included the viscosity effect of the fluid. The sound pressure distribution in the air gap, including fluid viscosity, was calculated by the FEA because it is expected to be dominant and thus have a strong effect on the sound pressure field in such a thin fluid layer. Based on the FEA results of the stepped and the tapered reflectors, it was determined that acoustic traveling waves could propagate along the gaps. Experiments were carried out with the designed bending vibrator and the reflectors. The acoustic fields in the air gap were measured via a fiber optic probe, and it was determined that the sound pressure and the phase distribution tendencies corresponded well with the results computed by FEA. Through our experiments, one-way airflow generation, in the same direction of the traveling wave and with the maximum flow velocity of 5.6 cm/s, was achieved.",2020-05-02T02:15:00.049982,pubmed,6,44842497,1262304000,An Ultrasonic Air Pump using an Acoustic Traveling Wave along a Small Air Gap,253-61,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0885-3010,ieee-transactions-on-ultrasonics-ferroelectrics-and-frequency-control,IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,"Ieee Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control",1588385700,57,1,Daisuke Koyama,2,Yuji Wada,2010-01-01T00:00:00,1588385700,an-ultrasonic-air-pump-using-an-acoustic-traveling-wave-along-a-small-air-gap,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20040451,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1109/tuffc.2010.1403,2020-05-02T02:15:00.049982,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Kentaro Nakamura,Masato Nishikawa,Tatsuyuki Nakagawa,academic,Asia,JP,Japan,Tokyo Institute of Technology - Ookayama Campus,Tokyo Institute of Technology,Tokyo Tech,tokyo-kogyo-daigaku,Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku,121,1.201,academic,Asia,JP,Japan,Tokyo Institute of Technology - Ookayama Campus,Tokyo Institute of Technology,Tokyo Tech,tokyo-kogyo-daigaku,Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku,3,Kentaro Nakamura,4,Masato Nishikawa,,,,,5,,Tatsuyuki Nakagawa,TRUE,3658485,Kentaro Nakamura,kentaro-nakamura-b5c7c4c58ad14caaa8baa1b669cdcca9,,,,,Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku - Ookayama Campus,Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku - Ookayama Campus,,,,,,Hitoshi Kihara,,,,6,Hitoshi Kihara,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,3658485,Kentaro Nakamura,kentaro-nakamura-b5c7c4c58ad14caaa8baa1b669cdcca9,kentaro-nakamura-b5c7c4c58ad14caaa8baa1b669cdcca9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B Forsberg,N Stjernberg,"In this study town dwellers could detect poor air quality at concentrations well below current guidelines for outdoor air pollution. This suggests that questionnaire studies have a place in monitoring air quality. Six-monthly nitrogen dioxide concentrations correlated consistently with the prevalence of reported annoyance related to air pollution and traffic exhaust fumes. Black smoke and sulphur dioxide had no significant effects. The frequency of reporting annoyance reactions was higher among people with asthma, women, and people with lack of access to a car. A postal questionnaire was sent out in 55 urban areas in Sweden that had nearly identical air quality monitoring stations of the urban air monitoring network. From each area, 150 people aged 16-70 were randomly selected. The questionnaire contained questions on perception of air quality as well as a question on how often exhaust fumes were annoying. Motor vehicle exhaust fumes are the main source of atmospheric pollution in cities in industrialised countries. They cause respiratory disease and annoy people exposed to them. The relation between ambient exposure to air pollution mainly from motor vehicles and annoyance reactions in a general population was assessed. Also, the importance of factors such as age, sex, respiratory disease, access to the use of a car, and smoking habits on the reporting of these reactions was studied.",2020-05-01T02:52:37.841346,pubmed,3,35181853,852076800,People can Detect Poor Air Quality well below Guideline Concentrations: a Prevalence Study of Annoyance Reactions and Air Pollution from Traffic,44-8,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1351-0711,occupational-and-environmental-medicine,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and Environmental Medicine,1588301557,54,1,B Forsberg,2,N Stjernberg,1997-01-01T00:00:00,1588301557,people-can-detect-poor-air-quality-well-below-guideline-concentrations-a-prevalence-study-of-annoyance-reactions-and-air-pollution-from-traffic,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC1128634,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9072033,2020-05-01T02:52:37.841346,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,S Wall,,,,,,,,,,,,127,1.671,,,,,,,,,,3,S Wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1136/oem.54.1.44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K Yoshida,K Kamada,"This study evaluated the effect of five adhesive primers on the shear bond strength of a self-curing resin to cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy. The adhesive primers Acryl Bond (AB, Shofu), Cesead Opaque Primer (COP, Kuraray), Metacolor Opaque Bonding Liner (MOBL, Sun-Medical), Metal PrimerII (MPII, GC) and MR. Bond (MRB, Tokuyama) were used. A brass ring which was placed over the casting alloy disk surface non-primed or primed with each primer was filled with the self-curing MMA-PMMA resin. The specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 24 h and then immersed alternately in water baths at 4 C and 60 degrees C for 1 min each for up to 50000 thermal cycles before shear mode testing at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. All of the primers examined, except MOBL, improved the shear bond strength between the resin and Co-Cr alloy compared with nonprimed specimens prior to thermal cycling. Regardless of which primer was used, the shear bond strength significantly differed between thermal cycles 0 and 50000. However, after 50000 thermal cycles, the bond strengths of resin to Co-Cr alloy primed with COP or MPII were significantly greater than those of specimens primed with AB, MOBL or MRB and non-primed controls. This study indicated that COP and MPII are effective primers to obtain higher bond strength between resin and Co-Cr alloy.",2020-05-01T03:34:03.089854,pubmed,3,35512465,928195200,Adhesive Primers for Bonding Cobalt-Chromium Alloy to Resin,475-8,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0305-182X,journal-of-oral-rehabilitation,J Oral Rehabil,Journal of Oral Rehabilitation,1588304043,26,1,K Yoshida,2,K Kamada,1999-06-01T00:00:00,1588304043,adhesive-primers-for-bonding-cobalt-chromium-alloy-to-resin,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10397179,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1046/j.1365-2842.1999.00397.x,2020-05-01T03:34:03.089854,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,M Atsuta,,,,,,,,,,,,84,1.027,,,,,,,,,,3,M Atsuta,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thaís A Fornari,Paula B Donate,"Gene expression of peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs) in stromal medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) is a key process to the negative selection of autoreactive thymocytes. This phenomenon was termed ""promiscuous gene expression"" (PGE), which is partially controlled by the Aire gene. Nevertheless, reasons for the correlation of Aire and PTAs with the emergence of autoimmune diseases are largely unknown, though it may be a result of a chronological effect. Although the effect of Aire mutations in pathogenic autoimmunity is well know, it could not be a unique cause for autoimmunity. Independently of mutations, temporal deregulation of Aire expression may imbalance Aire-dependent PTAs and/or wide PGE. This deregulation may be an early warning sign for autoimmune diseases as it guarantees autoantigen representation in the thymus. To assess this hypothesis, we studied the expression levels of Aire, Aire-dependent (Ins2) and Aire-independent (Gad67 and Col2a1) PTAs using real-time-PCR of the thymic stromal cells of NOD mice during the development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM-1). Wide PGE was studied by microarrays in which the PTA genes were identified through parallel CD80(+) mTEC 3.10 cell line expression profiling. The results show that Aire gene was down-regulated in young pre-autoimmune (pre-diabetic) NOD mice. PGE and specific PTA genes were down-regulated in adult autoimmune diabetic animals. These findings represent evidence indicating that chronological deregulation of genes important to negative selection may be associated with the development of an autoimmune disease (DM-1) in mice.",2020-05-02T01:55:29.791897,pubmed,6,44672027,1283299200,Age-Related Deregulation of Aire and Peripheral Tissue Antigen Genes in the Thymic Stroma of Non-Obese Diabetic (Nod) Mice is Associated with Autoimmune Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (Dm-1),21-8,1-2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0300-8177,molecular-and-cellular-biochemistry,Mol.

A Holmström,J Larsson,"To assess the viability of traumatized skeletal muscle, only clinical criteria have been available. Discolouration of the muscle following the trauma is one such criterion, and was earlier found to be associated with impaired circulation and severe metabolic disorders. The present study, continuing investigations into the pathophysiologic basis for the clinical criteria, was concerned with local electrolyte and water changes in skeletal muscle subjected to high-energy trauma. Biopsies were made from discoloured traumatized muscle and from adjacent normally coloured muscle 1, 5 and 10 hours after the trauma. Discoloured muscle showed little change in water content, but elevated values of Na+ and Cl- and very low K+ and Mg++ values. The changes progressed with time and showed no tendency to reversibility. The adjacent normally coloured muscle did not differ in electrolyte or water content from nontraumatized muscle. The magnitude of the electrolyte changes in discoloured muscle implied very severe cellular damage. This could have been due to mechanical disruption caused by the pressure wave, or to inability of the muscle cell to maintain a normal transmembrane potential, or to both factors. The findings correlate well with results of earlier metabolic and circulatory studies indicating that discolouration of traumatized skeletal muscle signifies nonviability.",2020-04-30T19:32:50.338051,pubmed,2,29702777,473385600,Local Changes of Skeletal Muscle Electrolytes and Water after High-Energy Trauma,115-9,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,acta-chirurgica-scandinavica,Acta Chir Scand,Acta Chirurgica Scandinavica,1588275170,151,1,A Holmström,2,J Larsson,1985-01-01T00:00:00,1588275170,local-changes-of-skeletal-muscle-electrolytes-and-water-after-high-energy-trauma,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,4002973,,,,,2020-04-30T19:32:50.338051,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N Ahmad,D E Noakes,"Physical characteristics of semen quality were studied over a 12 month period in 10 post pubertal, young male goats (7-19 months of age) maintained under the naturally prevailing climatic conditions characteristic of the South of England (latitude N 51 degrees 46'). Semen was collected fort-nightly using an artificial vagina and an ovariectomized, oestrogenized teaser doe. The physical appearance of the ejaculates varied from a yellow or whitish-yellow colour during September-December to a creamy-white colour during the remainder of the year. Ejaculate volume decreased from 0.96 +/- 0.06 ml in October to the minimum value of 0.39 +/- 0.03 ml in April and 0.38 +/- 0.02 ml in July, after which there was a sharp increase to the highest value, 1.04 +/- 0.05 ml, in September. Sperm cell concentration per ml was lowest (3.66 +/- 0.16 x 10(9)), during November and highest (6.56 +/- 0.29 x 10(9)) during May. However, the total sperm per ejaculate were highest during the September and lowest in December. The mass and individual motilities were higher during August-December than in the remainder of the year. The percentages of dead and morphologically abnormal spermatozoa were highest during May.

L Mittaz,C Rossier,"Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by Addison's disease and/or hypoparathyroidism and/or chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Patients may also have other clinical symptoms both within and outside the endocrine system, mainly as a result of autoimmunity against organ-specific autoantigens. The gene for APECED has recently been identified and termed AIRE (for AutoImmune REgulator). APECED is a model of organ-specific autoimmunity and isolation and characterization of the homologous mouse gene, Aire, will provide tools for dissection of the mechanisms underlying this human disorder and defining molecular pathways involved in organ-specific autoimmunity. We have isolated and completely sequenced the mouse Aire gene which is split into 14 exons over 13 kb and encodes a predicted protein of 552 amino acids. The predicted mouse and human AIRE proteins are 71% identical and contain motifs suggestive of a transcriptional regulator. Additional conserved motifs are emerging in the AIRE/Aire proteins including a nuclear localization signal, an ""ASS"" domain, and a ""SAND"" domain. The human and mouse AIRE promoters have conserved sites for several thymus-specific transcription factors and others important in hematopoesis, consistent with its expression in rare cells of the thymus medulla, lymph nodes, and fetal liver.

A Hollerweger,P Macheiner,"The veins of the calf muscles are a common site of acute DVT and a source of pulmonary embolism. They should always be investigated in patients with suspected DVT of the calf, and in patients with pulmonary embolism. Diagnosis of DVT was made by means of colour Doppler sonography in 179 patients. Soleal veins (n = 88), peroneal veins (n = 84), the popliteal vein (n = 69), and the superficial femoral vein (n = 53) were the most common sites of thrombosis. Thrombosis of the gastrocnemial veins (n = 49) occurred less frequently. 85 patients (47% of all patients having DVT) showed isolated calf vein thrombosis, in 45 patients (25%) the gastrocnemial and/or soleal veins were the only site of thrombosis. 60% of patients with symptomatic DVT also had pulmonary embolism. The embolic frequency for isolated calf vein thrombosis and muscular calf vein thrombosis was 48% and 50%, respectively. 357 consecutive patients submitted for colour Doppler sonography of the lower extremities were prospectively examined for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Both axial and muscular calf veins were investigated. 184 of these patients underwent additional investigation for pulmonary embolism.

G Cheddar,T E Meyer,"The effect of ionic strength on the rate constant for electron transfer has been used to determine the magnitude and charge sign of the net electrostatic potential which exists in close proximity to the sites of electron transfer on various c-type cytochromes. The negatively charged ferricyanide ion preferentially reacts at the positively charged exposed heme edge region on the front side of horse cytochrome c and Paracoccus cytochrome c2. In contrast, at low ionic strength, the positively charged cobalt phenanthroline ion interacts with the negatively charged back side of cytochrome c2, and at high ionic strength at a positively charged site on the front side of the cytochrome. With horse cytochrome c, over the ionic strength range studied, cobalt phenanthroline reacts only at a positively charged site which is probably not at the heme edge. These inorganic oxidants do not react at the relatively uncharged exposed heme edge sites on Azotobacter cytochrome c5 and Pseudomonas cytochrome c-551, but rather at a negatively charged site which is away from the heme edge. The results demonstrate that at least two electron-transferring sites on a single cytochrome can be functional, depending on the redox reactant used and the ionic strength. Electrostatic interactions between charge distributions on the cytochrome surface and the other reactant, or interactions involving uncharged regions on the protein(s), are critical in determining the preferred sites of electron transfer and reaction rate constants. When unfavorable electrostatic effects occur at a site near the redox center, less optimal sites at a greater distance can become kinetically important.",2020-04-30T18:31:20.635907,pubmed,5,27860382,617328000,Redox Protein Electron-Transfer Mechanisms: Electrostatic Interactions as a Determinant of Reaction Site in C-Type Cytochromes,6318-22,15,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0006-2960,biochemistry,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,1588271480,28,1,G Cheddar,2,T E Meyer,1989-07-25T00:00:00,1588271480,redox-protein-electron-transfer-mechanisms-electrostatic-interactions-as-a-determinant-of-reaction-site-in-c-type-cytochromes,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2551370,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/bi00441a025,2020-04-30T18:31:20.635907,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,,,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,,,M A Cusanovich,C D Stout,G Tollin,academic,Americas,US,United States,The University of Arizona Outreach College,The Ua,,the-university-of-arizona,The University of Arizona,231,1.556,academic,Americas,US,United States,The University of Arizona Outreach College,The Ua,,the-university-of-arizona,The University of Arizona,3,M A Cusanovich,4,C D Stout,,,,,5,,G Tollin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D L Rosenfeld,C E Cordell,"Fourteen neonates with posterior mediastinal air collections (retrocardiac pneumomediastinum) are described. In the majority of the infants (13 of 14), the mediastinal air developed as a complication of assisted ventilation. It is suggested that the retrocardiac pneumomediastinum represents air trapped in a potential space in the mediastinum posterior to the heart and not within the pulmonary ligament. The collections have a variable shape and size and rarely may produce a tension phenomenon elevating the posterior, inferior portion of the heart off of the diaphragm. There was a strong association of retrocardiac pneumomediastinum with other manifestations of extraalveolar air, including pulmonary interstitial emphysema (13 of 14 infants), pneumothorax (10 of 14 infants), dissection of air into the soft tissues of the neck (10 of 14 infants), and pneumoperitoneum (5 of 14 infants).",2020-04-30T18:23:41.045317,pubmed,3,27640611,631152000,Retrocardiac Pneumomediastinum: Radiographic Finding and Clinical Implications,92-7,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0031-4005,pediatrics,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,1588271021,85,1,D L Rosenfeld,2,C E Cordell,1990-01-01T00:00:00,1588271021,retrocardiac-pneumomediastinum-radiographic-finding-and-clinical-implications,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2296498,,,,,2020-04-30T18:23:41.045317,case-reports,case reports,,,case-reports,case reports,,,N Jadeja,,,,,,,,,,,,311,2.996,,,,,,,,,,3,N Jadeja,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S M Fiser,C G Tribble,"Lung transplant reperfusion injury occurs in two phases. The early phase is mediated by donor pulmonary macrophages and is followed by a late injury induced by recipient circulating leukocytes. The gadolinium chloride group had significantly improved arterial oxygenation and pulmonary artery pressure measurements compared with control subjects and an improved arterial oxygenation compared with the filter group after 30 minutes of reperfusion. After 120 minutes of reperfusion, however, the filter group had significantly improved arterial oxygenation and pulmonary artery pressure measurements compared with the control group and an improved arterial oxygenation compared with the gadolinium chloride group. With our isolated, ventilated, blood-perfused rabbit lung model, all groups underwent lung harvest followed by 18-hour cold storage and 2-hour blood reperfusion. Measurements of pulmonary artery pressure, lung compliance, and arterial oxygenation were obtained. Group I (n = 8) served as a control. Group II (n = 8) received gadolinium chloride at 14 mg/kg 24 hours before lung harvest. Group III (n = 8) received leukocyte-depleted blood reperfusion by means of a leukocyte filter.

G-H Cai,K Bröms,"Abstract Sweden has had allergen-avoidance day care centers (AADCs) since 1979. The aim of this study was to measure fungal DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a new method, in AADCs and ordinary day care centers (ODCs) and examine associations between allergen levels and building characteristics. Dust samples were collected by swabbing doorframes, vacuum-cleaning, and using Petri dishes. In total, 11 AADCs and 11 ODCs were studied (70 rooms). Total fungal DNA, measured by qPCR in the swab dust, was detected in 89%, Aspergillus or Penicillium (Asp/Pen) DNA in 34%, and Stachybotrys chartarum DNA in 6% of the rooms. Total fungal DNA was significantly higher in rooms with linoleum floor (P = 0.02), textile carpets (P = 0.03), reported dampness/molds (P = 0.02) and reported odor (P < 0.001) in the buildings, and significantly lower in wooden facade buildings (P = 0.003). Reported odor was related to the amount of sieved fine dust, reported dampness/molds and type of building construction. Total fungal DNA was related to cat, dog, horse and total allergen levels (P = 0.003) in the day care centers. In conclusion, total fungal DNA is related to reported dampness/molds, reported odor, and type of wall construction. The association between fungal and allergen contamination indicated a general 'hygiene factor' related to biological contaminants. Practical Implications The associations between fungal DNA, reported dampness/molds, and odor support the view that buildings with odor problems should be investigated for possible hidden fungal growth. There is a need to measure fungal biomass in different types of building constructions by monitoring fungal DNA. Analysis of fungal DNA with quantitative PCR can be a fast and practical way to study indoor fungal contamination. Swabbing dust from the doorframe of the main entrance to the room can be a convenient method of sampling dust for fungal DNA analysis. The high prevalence of reported dampness/molds and the common occurrence of fungal DNA indicate the need to improve the indoor environment of Swedish day care centers.",2020-05-02T02:11:07.167741,pubmed,8,44808741,1254355200,Quantitative Pcr Analysis of Fungal Dna in Swedish Day Care Centers and Comparison with Building Characteristics and Allergen Levels,392-400,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0905-6947,indoor-air,Indoor Air,Indoor Air,1588385467,19,1,G-H Cai,2,K Bröms,2009-10-01T00:00:00,1588385467,quantitative-pcr-analysis-of-fungal-dna-in-swedish-day-care-centers-and-comparison-with-building-characteristics-and-allergen-levels,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19500176,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1111/j.1600-0668.2009.00600.x,2020-05-02T02:11:07.167741,comparative-study,comparative study,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,comparative-study,comparative study,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,B Mälarstig,Z-H Zhao,J L Kim,academic,Europe,SE,Sweden,Uppsala University,,,uppsala-universitet,Uppsala Universitet,88,1.616,academic,Europe,SE,Sweden,Uppsala University,,,uppsala-universitet,Uppsala Universitet,3,B Mälarstig,4,Z-H Zhao,,,,,5,,J L Kim,TRUE,4922722,Dan Norbäck,dan-norback,,,,,,,,,,,,K Svärdsudd,C Janson,,,6,K Svärdsudd,7,C Janson,D Norbäck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,D Norbäck,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,4922722,Dan Norbäck,dan-norback,dan-norback,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
S Curci,T Schettino,"Intracellular chloride activity (acCl) and serosal as well as mucosal membrane potentials (Vcs and Vcm) were recorded in surface epithelial cells (SEC) of frog gastric mucosa during the resting state (cimetidine, 10(-4) mol/l) or during stimulation with histamine (10(-4) mol/l). Stimulation leads to a fall in acCl from 18.7 SD +/- 5.9 mmol/l (n = 26) to 13.3 SD +/- 4.9 mmol/l (n = 33). Simultaneously both cell membranes hyperpolarize, Vcs from -56.0 SD +/- 4.8 (n = 42) to -62.8 +/- 7.6 (n = 43) and Vcm from -39.6 SD +/- 5.8 (n = 42) to -47.9 +/- 7.6 (n = 43), so that intracellular chloride remains elevated above electrochemical equilibrium at both cell membranes. Reduction or omission of chloride in the lumen perfusate does not affect acCl, suggesting that the luminal cell membrane is virtually tight for chloride ions. Current induced hyperpolarization of the serosal cell membrane potential which simulates the electrical effects of stimulation, does not affect acCl either; however, inhibition of gastric acid secretion by a benzimidazol derivative which is known to block the H+/K+ ATPase prevents the fall in acCl in response to histamine. The same holds if the experimental solutions are gassed with 25% CO2 which does not interfere with acid secretion but may block cell to cell communication via gap junctions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",2020-04-30T18:46:08.260993,pubmed,3,28299054,507600000,Histamine Reduces Cl- Activity in Surface Epithelial Cells of Frog Gastric Mucosa.

A L Pasanen,,"While the fungal exposure assessment was based on the determination of fungal propagules for a long time, recent progress has led to the development of methodology for other fungal agents, e.g. the fungal cell wall components, metabolites, and allergens, that may be responsible for health effects caused by fungal exposure. This review includes a summary of the sampling techniques and analytical methods that are currently used or are in progress for the fungal exposure assessment. Prospects for the future trends are also discussed. In the future, the development will focus on sampling techniques that allow longer sampling times, a higher sampling efficiency for relevant particle sizes, and better possibilities for a wide range of analyses. In addition, new or modified methodology based on chemical, immunochemical, and molecular biological techniques to measure fungal agents related to health effects will improve the understanding of biological responses caused by fungal exposure.",2020-05-01T06:33:49.823944,pubmed,1,36757801,991353600,A Review: Fungal Exposure Assessment in Indoor Environments,87-98,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0905-6947,indoor-air,Indoor Air,Indoor Air,1588314829,11,1,A L Pasanen,,,2001-06-01T00:00:00,1588314829,a-review-fungal-exposure-assessment-in-indoor-environments,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,11394015,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1034/j.1600-0668.2001.110203.x,2020-05-01T06:33:49.823944,review,review,,,review,review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,88,1.616,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aaron J Cohen,H Ross Anderson,"As part of the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Burden of Disease Comparative Risk Assessment, the burden of disease attributable to urban ambient air pollution was estimated in terms of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Air pollution is associated with a broad spectrum of acute and chronic health effects, the nature of which may vary with the pollutant constituents. Particulate air pollution is consistently and independently related to the most serious effects, including lung cancer and other cardiopulmonary mortality. The analyses on which this report is based estimate that ambient air pollution, in terms of fine particulate air pollution (PM(2.5)), causes about 3% of mortality from cardiopulmonary disease, about 5% of mortality from cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung, and about 1% of mortality from acute respiratory infections in children under 5 yr, worldwide. This amounts to about 0.8 million (1.2%) premature deaths and 6.4 million (0.5%) years of life lost (YLL). This burden occurs predominantly in developing countries; 65% in Asia alone. These estimates consider only the impact of air pollution on mortality (i.e., years of life lost) and not morbidity (i.e., years lived with disability), due to limitations in the epidemiologic database. If air pollution multiplies both incidence and mortality to the same extent (i.e., the same relative risk), then the DALYs for cardiopulmonary disease increase by 20% worldwide.",2020-05-01T17:10:54.410724,pubmed,11,41086708,,The Global Burden of Disease due to Outdoor Air Pollution,1301-7,13-14,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1528-7394,journal-of-toxicology-and-environmental-health-part-a,J.

M E Razzoog,S Koka,"Under the experimental conditions tested, neither of the two systems tested seemed to cause significant abrasion of the surface of titanium abutment cylinders. A comparison of abutment cylinder surfaces after treatment showed that the Prophy-Jet system removed machining marks to a greater degree than the Microprophy system. Sodium bicarbonate particles from the Prophy-Jet system were significantly larger than the aluminum oxide particles used with the Microprophy system, potentially accounting for the difference in abrasivity. In addition, inlet air pressure of 60 psi caused removal of machining marks to a greater degree than an inlet air pressure of 90 psi. The principle of phase separation may account for the lower inlet air pressure causing more removal of machining marks than the higher inlet air pressure. Single abutment cylinders were treated with either the Prophy-Jet system (sodium bicarbonate abrasive) (Dentsply International, York, PA) or the Microprophy system (aluminum oxide abrasive) (Danville Engineering Co, Danville, CA) for 60 seconds at an inlet air pressure of 60 psi or 90 psi. The effects on the surface of each abutment cylinder were visually inspected by scanning electron microscopy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of two air-abrasive prophylaxis systems and the effect of inlet air pressure on the surface of Brånemark titanium abutment cylinders.",2020-05-01T02:53:33.420417,pubmed,2,35189233,770428800,In Vitro Analysis of the Effects of two Air-Abrasive Prophylaxis Systems and Inlet Air Pressure on the Surface of Titanium Abutment Cylinders,103-7,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1059-941X,journal-of-prosthodontics-official-journal-of-the-american-college-of-prosthodontists,J Prosthodont,Journal of Prosthodontics : Official Journal of the American College of Prosthodontists,1588301613,3,1,M E Razzoog,2,S Koka,1994-06-01T00:00:00,1588301613,in-vitro-analysis-of-the-effects-of-two-air-abrasive-prophylaxis-systems-and-inlet-air-pressure-on-the-surface-of-titanium-abutment-cylinders,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1111/j.1532-849x.1994.tb00136.x,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9227105,2020-05-01T02:53:33.420417,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,,,,academic,Americas,US,United States,U-M,,,university-of-michigan,University of Michigan,52,0.742,academic,Americas,US,United States,U-M,,,university-of-michigan,University of Michigan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
D Conte Camerino,A De Luca,"Taurine reduces the excitability of striated muscle fibers by increasing the membrane conductance to chloride ions (GCl). This action was tested on rats made myotonic by drugs that block GCl by different mechanisms. Experiments were made ""in vivo"" using electromyographic (EMG) recordings and ""in vitro"" with intracellular microelectrode recordings from extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers. Taurine did not antagonize the myotonic discharges produced in vivo by anthracene-9-carboxylic acid, nor did it restore GCl lowered in vitro by this agent. However, when myotonia was chronically induced by 20,25 diazacholesterol, taurine given chronically in vivo or acutely in vitro antagonized the EMG myotonia as well as the reduced GCl and increased excitability of single fibers. We conclude that taurine acts directly on chloride channels to modify their kinetics. Our findings suggest that further clinical studies on the use of taurine in muscle disease involving abnormal excitability or chloride channel function will be useful.",2020-04-30T18:26:49.379067,pubmed,7,27729126,625881600,The Effects of Taurine on Pharmacologically Induced Myotonia,898-904,11,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0148-639X,muscle-nerve,Muscle Nerve,Muscle & Nerve,1588271209,12,1,D Conte Camerino,2,A De Luca,1989-11-01T00:00:00,1588271209,the-effects-of-taurine-on-pharmacologically-induced-myotonia,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2608084,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1002/mus.880121105,2020-04-30T18:26:49.379067,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,M Mambrini,E Ferrannini,F Franconi,,,,,,,,,,133,0.95,,,,,,,,,,3,M Mambrini,4,E Ferrannini,,,,,5,,F Franconi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,A Giotti,S H Bryant,,,6,A Giotti,7,S H Bryant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bernhard Spingler,,"Various weakly binding cations and anions were studied at a concentration of 10 mM to ascertain their interaction with the nickel(II) promoted B- to Z-DNA transition of poly d(GC). These salts were ranked according to the decreasing amounts of nickel needed for the B- to Z-DNA transition and provided the following order: NaCl approximately Me4NCl > LiCl >> MgCl2 > no salt > NaBF4 approximately NaNO3 approximately NaClO4. Remarkably, it was found that going from sodium nitrate to sodium chloride increased the necessary amount of nickel to induce the transition to the left-handed helix of poly d(GC) by a factor of 10. This dramatic effect cannot be explained by the binding constant of nickel(II) to chloride to form the monocationic complex.

Mahesh B Kaliwal,Ashwani Kumar,"The density of female Cx. quinquefasciatus encountered in all the months was higher than the estimated tolerated level of density of 34 per ten man hours up to which there is no risk of filariasis transmission. The strong correlation between the abdominal conditions and relative humidity, rainfall and number of rainy days imply that these meteorological variables significantly influenced the feeding and fecundity of the species. 85.3 per cent of the indoor resting population comprising of fed, semi-gravid and gravid females confirmed the endophilic nature of the species. The preferential resting behavior of both females and males on hanging objects suggest that use of insecticide treated long-lasting bed nets as personal protective measure can be exploited to reduce the density of the vector species. Cx. quinquefasciatus adults were prevalent perennially in Panaji with highest per man hour density of females (48.6) in February and the lowest density (6.6) in September. Monthly variations in the densities between different months was significant (F=15.3; P<0.05). Rainfall significantly influenced the population of Cx. quinquefasciatus (t=2.63; P<0.05). Fed group and semi-gravid group showed a strong correlation with the relative humidity (P<0.05), rain fall (P<0.05) and number of rainy days (P<0.05). 62.4 per cent of females and 65.1 per cent of males preferred to rest on hanging objects. Spatio-temporal variations in the number of Cx. quinquefasciatus females and males resting on different sites and also the variations in different sites (P<0.05) were significant. Panaji was divided into six zones and a total of 240 man hours were spent in 60 fixed catching sites to collect the adult Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes on fortnightly basis from indoor resting sites during 2005-06. The female mosquitoes were classified as unfed, fed, semi-gravid and gravid to ascertain the resting behavior of Cx. quinquefasciatus adults.

O Nerbrink,M Dahlbäck,"Previous work done on the characterisation of nebulizers has focused on gravimetrical output and particle/droplet size distribution at various air flow rates. This paper investigates six different nebulizers, with regard to droplet generation and separation properties, at a single air flow rate. Droplet generation and separation properties were measured with laser diffraction and impactor techniques. For each of the nebulizers the air velocity was calculated and both liquid and air volumetric flow rate was measured. The primary generated droplets (nebulizer without impaction baffle) had a mean size of between 15 microns and > 500 microns. The secondary generated droplets (nebulizer with baffle) were in the size range of 1 to 10 microns. It was found that the baffle system of the investigated nebulizers could be described according to ordinary impaction theory. The mass median diameters (MMD) of these nebulizers were found to be dependent on air velocity (vg), and ratio of liquid to air volumetric flow rate (Ql/Qa). In all of the nebulizers, between 93% and 99% of the generated primary droplets were caught by the baffle system which resulted in a very low output. Thus, the nebulizers examined do not appear to be optimised, with regard to observed droplet generation and baffle arrangements, if secondary droplets with a size approximately 1 micron are desired. By changing the design at the primary generation point, air velocity (vg) and liquid to air flow rate (Ql/Qa), the primary generated droplet size could be decreased. This would result in an increase in the number concentration of smaller droplets that pass the baffle system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",2020-05-01T02:43:37.783992,pubmed,3,35109542,757382400,Why do Medical Nebulizers Differ in their Output and Particle Size Characteristics,259-76,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,journal-of-aerosol-medicine-the-official-journal-of-the-international-society-for-aerosols-in-medicine,J Aerosol Med,Journal of Aerosol Medicine : the Official Journal of the International Society for Aerosols in Medicine,1588301017,7,1,O Nerbrink,2,M Dahlbäck,1994-01-01T00:00:00,1588301017,why-do-medical-nebulizers-differ-in-their-output-and-particle-size-characteristics,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1089/jam.1994.7.259,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10150483,2020-05-01T02:43:37.783992,,,,,,,,,H C Hansson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,H C Hansson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K Sakuma,R Kakigi,"We investigated the olfactory evoked magnetic fields (OEFs) in 14 normal subjects. Pulses of odorant air containing amyl acetate or phenethyl alcohol, and odorless air were administered to the subject through a nasal tube. A clear and consistent OEF component, 1M, was identified in all subjects, and a second component, 2M, was detected in seven subjects, but no consistent component was identified in response to the odorless air. The peak latencies of the 1M and 2M components were approximately 320 and 630 ms, respectively. The waveforms produced by the odorless air were subtracted from the waveforms produced by the odorant air to obtain the 'subtraction' waveform, which indicated the 1M and 2M component more clearly. Their equivalent current dipoles (ECDs) were estimated in the regions around the Sylvian fissure symmetrically in both hemispheres.

Tracey J Woodruff,Jennifer D Parker,"Reviews find a likely adverse effect of air pollution on perinatal outcomes, but variation of findings hinders the ability to incorporate the research into policy. The International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes (ICAPPO) was formed to better understand relationships between air pollution and adverse birth outcomes through standardized parallel analyses in datasets from different countries. A planning group with 10 members from 6 countries was formed to coordinate the project. Collaboration participants have datasets with air pollution values and birth outcomes. Eighteen research groups with data for approximately 20 locations in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America are participating, with most participating in an initial pilot study. Datasets generally cover the 1990s. Number of births is generally in the hundreds of thousands, but ranges from around 1,000 to about one million. Almost all participants have some measure of particulate matter, and most have ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide. Strong enthusiasm for participating and a geographically-diverse range of participants should lead to understanding uncertainties about the role of air pollution in perinatal outcomes and provide decision-makers with better tools to account for pregnancy outcomes in air pollution policies.",2020-05-02T02:31:06.452406,pubmed,9,44994400,1275350400,International Collaboration on Air Pollution and Pregnancy Outcomes (Icappo),2638-52,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1660-4601,international-journal-of-environmental-research-and-public-health,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,1588386666,7,1,Tracey J Woodruff,2,Jennifer D Parker,2010-06-01T00:00:00,1588386666,international-collaboration-on-air-pollution-and-pregnancy-outcomes-icappo,journal-article,journal article,http://europepmc.org/articles/,pmc,pmc: PubMed Central article number,PMC2905570,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.3390/ijerph7062638,2020-05-02T02:31:06.452406,comparative-study,comparative study,,,comparative-study,comparative study,,,Kate Adams,Michelle L Bell,Ulrike Gehring,academic,Americas,US,United States,Ucsf,Uc San Francisco,,university-of-california-san-francisco,University of California San Francisco,78,0.818,academic,Americas,US,United States,Ucsf,Uc San Francisco,,university-of-california-san-francisco,University of California San Francisco,3,Kate Adams,4,Michelle L Bell,TRUE,6079164,Ulrike Gehring,ulrike-gehring,5,ulrike-gehring,Ulrike Gehring,TRUE,2847962,Michelle Bell,michelle-bell,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20644693,,,,,,,,Svetlana Glinianaia,Eun-Hee Ha,,,6,Svetlana Glinianaia,7,Eun-Hee Ha,Bin Jalaludin,Rémy Slama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,Bin Jalaludin,9,Rémy Slama,,,TRUE,4010522,Remy Slama,remy-slama,TRUE,2847962,Michelle Bell,michelle-bell,michelle-bell,air pollution,preterm birth,particulate matter,pregnancy outcomes,low birthweight,ozone carbon monoxide,air-pollution,air pollution,preterm-birth,preterm birth,particulate-matter,particulate matter,pregnancy-outcomes,pregnancy outcomes,low-birthweight,low birthweight,ozone-carbon-monoxide,ozone carbon monoxide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,6079164,Ulrike Gehring,ulrike-gehring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,4010522,Remy Slama,remy-slama,remy-slama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
M L Tierney,B Birnir,"The conserved leucine residues at the 9' positions in the M2 segments of alpha1 (L264) and beta1 (L259) subunits of the human GABAA receptor were replaced with threonine. Normal or mutant alpha1 subunits were co-expressed with normal or mutant beta1 subunits in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system. Cells in which one or both subunits were mutated had a higher ""resting"" chloride conductance than cells expressing wild-type alpha1beta1 receptors. This chloride conductance was blocked by 10 mM penicillin, a recognized blocker of GABAA channels, but not by bicuculline (100 microm) or picrotoxin (100 microm) which normally inhibit the chloride current activated by GABA: nor was it potentiated by pentobarbitone (100 microM). In cells expressing wild-type beta1 with mutated alpha1 subunits, an additional chloride current could be elicited by GABA but the rise time and decay were slower than for wild-type alpha1beta1 receptors. In cells expressing mutated beta1 subunits with wild-type or mutated alpha1 subunits (alphabeta(L9'T) and alpha(L9'T)beta(L9'T)), no response to GABA could be elicited: this was not due to an absence of GABAA receptors in the plasmalemma because the cells bound [3H]-muscimol. It was concluded that in GABAA channels containing the L9'T mutation in the beta1 subunit, GABA-binding does not cause opening of channels, and that the L9'T mutation in either or both subunits gives an open-channel state of the GABAA receptor in the absence of ligand.",2020-05-01T02:00:26.769123,pubmed,7,34795695,846806400,Effects of Mutating Leucine to Threonine in the M2 Segment of Alpha1 and Beta1 Subunits of Gabaa Alpha1Beta1 Receptors,11-21,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-2631,the-journal-of-membrane-biology,J.

Hendrik Schäfer,Ian R Mcdonald,"Marine bacteria that oxidized methyl bromide and methyl chloride were enriched and isolated from seawater samples. Six methyl halide-oxidizing enrichments were established from which 13 isolates that grew on methyl bromide and methyl chloride as sole sources of carbon and energy were isolated and maintained. All isolates belonged to three different clades in the Roseobacter group of the alpha subdivision of the Proteobacteria and were distinct from Leisingera methylohalidivorans, the only other identified marine bacterium that grows on methyl bromide as sole source of carbon and energy. Genes encoding the methyltransferase/corrinoid-binding protein CmuA, which is responsible for the initial step of methyl chloride oxidation in terrestrial methyl halide-oxidizing bacteria, were detected in enrichments and some of the novel marine strains. Gene clusters containing cmuA and other genes implicated in the metabolism of methyl halides were cloned from two of the isolates. Expression of CmuA during growth on methyl halides was demonstrated by analysis of polypeptides expressed during growth on methyl halides by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry in two isolates representing two of the three clades. These findings indicate that certain marine methyl halide degrading bacteria from the Roseobacter group contain a methyltransferase pathway for oxidation of methyl bromide that may be similar to that responsible for methyl chloride oxidation in Methylobacterium chloromethanicum. This pathway therefore potentially contributes to cycling of methyl halides in both terrestrial and marine environments.",2020-05-01T17:11:55.942216,pubmed,4,41113131,1117584000,Evidence for the Presence of a Cmua Methyltransferase Pathway in Novel Marine Methyl Halide-Oxidizing Bacteria,839-52,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1462-2912,environmental-microbiology,Environ.

M Soleimani,G L Bizal,"Based on the transport activities and inhibitor sensitivities, different functional modes of anion exchangers have been identified in the kidney proximal tubule including chloride/formate, chloride/oxalate, chloride/hydroxyl, and chloride/bicarbonate exchange. There is little information on the molecular structure and properties of the protein(s) involved in these processes. Previously, using stilbene affinity matrix and Pac Q chromatography, we partially purified a protein with anion exchange properties in brush border membranes (BBM) isolated from rabbit kidney proximal tubules. This protein has a molecular weight of 162 kDa. When reconstituted into liposomes, the fraction containing the 162 kDa protein demonstrated Cl-/Cl- exchange activity. In the current experiments, the 162 kDa protein was purified to homogeneity using a combination of affinity, ion exchange, and size exclusion chromatography. This protein has binding affinity for known inhibitors of anion exchangers. When reconstituted in liposomes, the 162 kDa protein showed anion exchange activity as assayed by 36Cl-/Cl- exchange. Functional studies in liposomes reconstituted with the purified 162 kDa protein in revealed that this protein mediates the transport of Cl-/formate and Cl-/HCO3-. The Cl-/formate and Cl-/HCO3- exchange activities in the reconstituted liposomes were inhibited in the presence of DIDS and furosemide, two known inhibitors of renal anion exchangers. We conclude that Cl-/formate exchange and and Cl-/HCO3- exchange in kidney proximal tubules are mediated via the same protein. This protein is distinct from the known anion exchanger proteins (AE1, AE2, and AE3) and may represent another isoform from this family of transporters.",2020-05-01T01:59:47.118198,pubmed,2,34790696,849398400,Functional Identity of a Purified Proximal Tubule Anion Exchanger Protein: Mediation of Chloride/Formate and Chloride/Bicarbonate Exchange,1914-21,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0085-2538,kidney-international,Kidney Int.,Kidney International,1588298387,50,1,M Soleimani,2,G L Bizal,1996-12-01T00:00:00,1588298387,functional-identity-of-a-purified-proximal-tubule-anion-exchanger-protein-mediation-of-chloride-formate-and-chloride-bicarbonate-exchange,journal-article,journal article,,pii,,S0085-2538(15)59807-4,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1038/ki.1996.513,2020-05-01T01:59:47.118198,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,research-support-us-govt-nonphs,research support us govt nonphs,research-support-us-govt-phs,research support us govt phs,,,,,,,,,,,,,250,3.331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,8943474,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R J Geor,L J Mccutcheon,"The objectives of this study were to: 1) determine the effects of heat and high relative humidity (RH) on the clinical and physiological responses of horses during and after daily exercise training and 2) determine whether repeated exposure to, and exercise in, the heat would result in improved thermal tolerance (heat acclimation). Six trained Thoroughbred horses completed 1 h of submaximal exercise in cool, dry conditions (CD) and during a daily 4 h period of exposure to high heat and humidity (HH, room temperature = 33-35 degrees C, RH = 80-85%) for 22 days. Rectal temperature (Tre) and heart rate (HR) were measured before, during and after exercise and respiratory rate (RR) was measured before exercise and during a 2 h recovery. In HH, the rate of rise in Tre was significantly higher than in CD. However, by HH Day 5, Tre before, during and after exercise was significantly lower than on HH Day 1. The day-to-day decrease in Tre during exercise was reflected in significant decreases in heat storage following exercise by HH Day 10 (910 +/- 47 kcal) when compared to HH Day 1 (1211 +/- 75 kcal). At rest, RR was initially higher in HH than CD, and a further increase in pre-exercise RR from HH Day 1 to Day 10 may have contributed to the lower pre-exercise Tre. Recovery RR was higher after HH Day 1 and was associated with a lower end-of-exercise HR did not change in the 1 h before exercise in CD and did not differ from HH Days 1-22. By HH Day 10, mean HR during the latter part of exercise was lower than HH Day 1 and was not different from pre-exercise by 60 min of recovery. Pre-exercise body mass did not change during the 3 wk period and the decrease in body mass that occurred during the 4 h training period was significantly attenuated by HH Day 15 (9.8 +/- 0.8 kg) when compared to HH Day 1 (12.5 +/- 0.8 kg). Over the 3 week period of HH, mean 24 h water consumption increased from 26.0 +/- 2.1 litres to 39.5 +/- 3.2 litres, largely reflecting a 2-fold increase in water intake during the 4 h period of heat exposure. It is concluded that 3 weeks of daily exposure to, and exercise in, hot and humid ambient conditions resulted in a progressive reduction in thermal and cardiovascular strain. Furthermore, the reported physiological adaptations are consistent with an improved thermal tolerance (heat acclimation).",2020-05-01T00:28:20.729630,pubmed,3,34140845,836179200,Adaptations to Daily Exercise in Hot and Humid Ambient Conditions in Trained Thoroughbred Horses,63-8,22,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,equine-veterinary-journal-supplement,Equine Vet J Suppl,Equine Veterinary Journal.

John Skelhorn,Candy Rowe,"Müllerian mimicry, where two unpalatable species share a warning pattern, is classically believed to be a form of mutualism, where the species involved share the cost of predator education. The evolutionary dynamics of Müllerian mimicry have recently become a controversial subject, after mathematical models have shown that if minor alterations are made to assumptions about the way in which predators learn and forget about unpalatable prey, this textbook case of mutualism may not be mutualistic at all. An underlying assumption of these models is that Müllerian mimics possess the same defence chemical. However, some Müllerian mimics are known to possess different defence chemicals. Using domestic chicks as predators and coloured crumbs flavoured with either the same or different unpalatable chemicals as prey, we provide evidence that two defence chemicals can interact to enhance predator learning and memory. This indicates that Müllerian mimics that possess different defence chemicals are better protected than those that share a single defence chemical. These data provide insight into how multiple defence chemicals are perceived by birds,and how they influence the way birds learn and remember warningly coloured prey. They highlight the importance of considering how different toxins in mimicry rings can interact in the evolution and maintenance of Müllerian mimicry and could help to explain the remarkable variation in chemical defences found within and between species.",2020-05-01T17:21:51.358200,pubmed,2,41384198,1107734400,Tasting the Difference: do Multiple Defence Chemicals Interact in Müllerian Mimicry,339-45,1560,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,proceedings-biological-sciences,Proc.

G Hartmann,C Thom,"This paper provides evidence that most of the Pu in the near surface air today is due to resuspension. Vertical and particle size distribution in near surface air over a period of three years were measured. The seasonal variations of Pu in air and the influence of meteorological parameters on these variations are shown. Samples were taken before the Chernobyl accident in an area where only Pu fallout from the atmospheric nuclear tests of the early sixties occurs. The comparison of the behavior of Pu with other trace elements, which were also measured, showed similar behavior of Pu and elements like Ca, Ti and Fe in near surface air. This confirms that most Pu is resuspended because the main source for these elements in air is the soil surface. Resuspension factors and resuspension rate are estimated for all measured elements. A resuspension factor of 0.8 X 10(-8) m-1 and a resuspension rate of 0.09 X 10(-9) s-1 is calculated for Pu.",2020-04-30T18:37:43.608571,pubmed,3,28045535,599616000,Sources for Pu in Near Surface Air,55-69,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0017-9078,health-physics,Health Phys,Health Physics,1588271863,56,1,G Hartmann,2,C Thom,1989-01-01T00:00:00,1588271863,sources-for-pu-in-near-surface-air,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,2909504,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1097/00004032-198901000-00005,2020-04-30T18:37:43.608571,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,K Bächmann,,,,,,,,,,,,64,0.405,,,,,,,,,,3,K Bächmann,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G R Evans,K Brandt,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of postoperative external cobalt-60 beam irradiation on nerve regeneration. Sixty-five 250-gm male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Peripheral nerve regeneration was measured by walking track analysis and histomorphology of the proximal, graft, and distal nerve segments. These 65 animals underwent a 1.5-cm interpositional nerve graft into the right posterior tibial nerve. The left leg served as a control. Each animal was then randomly allocated into one of four groups. Group 1 served as control. Groups 2 through 4 were subjected to external cobalt-60 gamma-ray irradiation through a 2.5-cm circular portal for a total fractionated dose of 30, 50, and 70 Gy beginning on postoperative day 3. Radiation was administered in 2-Gy fractions, 5 fractions per week, with a top-up dose of 16 Gy given at the end of the fractionated irradiation. Walking track analysis was performed at 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after nerve grafting. At the conclusion of 120 days, sections of the proximal, grafted, and distal nerve were harvested, stained, and examined histomorphologically. Hematoxylin and eosin stains also were obtained. Evaluation of the print-length index demonstrated no statistical difference between the unirradiated controls and the irradiated groups. The total number of axons per square millimeter and nerve fiber density per square millimeter were significantly decreased in the distal segment of all the irradiated groups when compared with controls. Despite the reduction in myelinated regenerating fibers, no reduction in function was observed, as measured by walking track analysis. We would therefore recommend immediate reconstruction of peripheral nerve defects in the face of postoperative irradiation.",2020-05-01T02:15:42.952943,pubmed,9,34906847,870393600,Peripheral Nerve Regeneration: the Effects of Postoperative Irradiation,375-80,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0032-1052,plastic-and-reconstructive-surgery,Plast.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether increased intranasal air pressure loads the major muscle of velopharyngeal closure, the levator veli palatini. Nine subjects, four with cleft palate and five without cleft palate, were studied. Electromyographic activity was measured from the levator veli palatini muscle with several levels of air pressure delivered to the nasal cavities using a commercially available CPAP instrument. It was found that levator veli palatini activity was significantly greater for the positive air pressure conditions than for the atmospheric pressure conditions for both subject groups. This indicates that the levator veli palatini muscle acts against the resistive load produced by the increased intranasal air pressure.

Sanjib Kr Sardar,Kambalapalli Srikanth,"The interaction of a ketocyanine dye with a cobalt(II) ion has been studied in solution by monitoring the electronic absorption and emission spectral characteristics of the dye. A new absorption band at a longer wavelength appears in solutions containing cobalt(II) ions. An isosbestic point is observed for systems containing a fixed dye concentration and varying Co(2+) ion concentration, pointing to the formation of a complex. The stoichiometry of the complex has been found to be 1:1. Equilibrium constant has been determined from the observed data. The nature of interaction between the dye (S(0) state) and the Co(II) ion is mostly electrostatic. Spectroscopic results have been supported by DFT/TDDFT calculation. The fluorescence band is characterized by a small blue shift. In the concentration range of 10(-3)-10(-4) M of the Co(II) ion, a quenching of the dye fluorescence is noticed. The Stern-Volmer plot points to the operation of both static and dynamic mechanisms of quenching. For a micromolar concentration of the Co(II) ion, however, an enhancement of fluorescence intensity with a slight blue shift has been observed, which has been explained in terms of formation of a different type of complex in the S(1) state at this concentration level. The value of lifetime increases at the micromolar level of concentration of the Co(II) ion, where the intensity increases and then remains practically unchanged as more salt is added to the system. Values of the decay constant for the different photophysical processes have been calculated. Complexation in the S(1) state is characterized by a slower decay of the excited dye by a nonradiative path.",2020-05-02T02:33:59.884361,pubmed,3,45022458,1285804800,Interaction of Ketocyanine Dye with a Co2+ Ion: an Electronic Spectroscopic Study,10388-94,38,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1089-5639,the-journal-of-physical-chemistry-a,J Phys Chem A,The Journal of Physical Chemistry. a,1588386839,114,1,Sanjib Kr Sardar,2,Kambalapalli Srikanth,2010-09-30T00:00:00,1588386839,interaction-of-ketocyanine-dye-with-a-co2-ion-an-electronic-spectroscopic-study,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20828117,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/jp102595z,2020-05-02T02:33:59.884361,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,Sanjib Bagchi,,,academic,Asia,IN,India,Iiser-K,Iiser Kolkata,,indian-institute-of-science-education-and-research-kolkata,Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata,212,0.969,academic,Asia,IN,India,Iiser-K,Iiser Kolkata,,indian-institute-of-science-education-and-research-kolkata,Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata,3,Sanjib Bagchi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kai-Uwe Goss,,"The sorption capacity of the air-water interface for organic chemicals can easily be much larger than the bulk water or bulk air phase of small water droplets or air bubbles in water, respectively. Therefore, adsorption constants must be known in addition to the bulk air/water partition constants to assess the transport capacity of such small droplets or bubbles. Here the quantum-chemical-based software COSMOtherm is tested for its ability to predict air-water adsorption constants for a diverse set of more than 200 organic compounds. To this end, the free energies of adsorption that are received as model output are converted into adsorption constants based on a reference state of adsorption that is derived here. This approach can be shown to predict adsorption constants with a root-mean-square error of 0.6 log units for K values ranging over seven orders of magnitude. In addition, the model's ability to predict enthalpies of adsorption is demonstrated.",2020-05-02T02:29:59.696344,pubmed,1,44982100,1257379200,Predicting Adsorption of Organic Chemicals at the Air-Water Interface,12256-9,44,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,1089-5639,the-journal-of-physical-chemistry-a,J Phys Chem A,The Journal of Physical Chemistry. a,1588386599,113,1,Kai-Uwe Goss,,,2009-11-05T00:00:00,1588386599,predicting-adsorption-of-organic-chemicals-at-the-air-water-interface,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19803507,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1021/jp907347p,2020-05-02T02:29:59.696344,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,212,0.969,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objective was to establish selection criteria for effective ligands for extractive fermentations with animal cells in ATPSs. In the presence of 1% PEG-dye-ligand the binding of IgG to the PEG-ligand was affected severely by the Na-chloride concentration. The tie-line length and pH affected IgG partitioning to a lesser extent. The desired partitioning of IgG into the top phase, was only obtained when, in addition to the 10 mmol/kg K-phosphate buffer, no Na-chloride was present. In an ATPS culture medium, with +/- 35 mmol/kg Na-bicarbonate and 60 mmol/kg Na-chloride, increasing the PEG-dye-ligand concentration up to 100% did increase the partition coefficient, but was not effective in concentrating the IgG in the top phase of ATPS culture medium at a pH of 7.8.

Yong-Bo Tang,Jia-Guo Zhou,"1. Transmembrane Cl(-) transport through volume-regulated Cl(-) channels (VRCC) is implicated in cell cycle control and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). In cerebrovascular VSMC, volume-regulated Cl(-) movement is enhanced with the severity of cerebrovascular remodelling induced by hypertension. 2. Expression of the ClC-3 chloride channel, a potential molecular candidate for the VRCC, is significantly increased with the progression of VSMC proliferation, but is decreased in apoptosis. 3. In the present review, we summarize recent findings regarding the functional role of volume-regulated ClC-3 chloride channels in VSMC proliferation, apoptosis and cerebrovascular remodelling during the development of hypertension. In addition, we discuss the relationship between the channel and intracellular signalling pathways, including the production of reactive oxygen species and the phosphorylation of Akt. 4. Recent studies strongly suggest that VRCC/ClC-3 is involved in the regulation of both cell proliferation and apoptosis. These findings suggest that ClC-3 chloride channels may be potential new targets for the prevention of the cerebrovascular remodelling that occurs during the development of hypertension.",2020-05-02T02:42:53.675311,pubmed,3,45116301,1264982400,Volume-Regulated Chloride Channels and Cerebral Vascular Remodelling,238-42,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0305-1870,clinical-and-experimental-pharmacology-physiology,Clin.

Ioana Pera,Rüdiger Stark,"To measure the interaction between two lipid bilayers with an atomic force microscope one solid supported bilayer was formed on a planar surface by spontaneous vesicle fusion. To spontaneously adsorb lipid bilayers also on the atomic force microscope tip, the tips were first coated with gold and a monolayer of mercapto undecanol. Calculations indicate that long-chain hydroxyl terminated alkyl thiols tend to enhance spontaneous vesicle fusion because of an increased van der Waals attraction as compared to short-chain thiols. Interactions measured between dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and dioleoyloxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride showed the electrostatic double-layer force plus a shorter-range repulsion which decayed exponentially with a decay length of 0.7 nm for dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, 1.2 nm for dioleoylphosphatidylserine, and 0.8 nm for dioleoyloxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride. The salt concentration drastically changed the interaction between dioleoyloxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride bilayers. As an example for the influence of proteins on bilayer-bilayer interaction, the influence of the synaptic vesicle-associated, phospholipid binding protein synapsin I was studied.

Early administration of choline chloride (during the dust factor exposure) increases concentration of those surfactants notable for their surface-active properties being maintained, and improves the processes of diffusion of surface-active substances, which observation is accompanied by decrease in intensity of the processes of fibroformation in the lung tissue. Choline chlorid employed on the discontinuation of the dust exposure has adverse effects leading to changes in the lipid composition, impairing the surface-active properties and processes of diffusion of the pulmonary surfactant, which fact may contribute to aggravation of fibrosis in the lungs.",2020-05-01T00:45:54.311833,pubmed,2,34268845,,The Correction of the Status of the Pulmonary Surfactant System as a Method for Preventing Experimental Pneumoconiosis,54-8,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,likars-ka-sprava,Lik.

Richard F Edlich,John R Wish,"This collective review has the following purposes. First we will describe each of the components of the Maryland State Police Aviation Division. We will then provide detailed information about the Atlas and Database of Air Medical Services (ADAMS) compiled by the center for transportation and injury research (Buffalo, New York) in alliance with the Association of Air Medical Services (Alexandria, Virginia) that provides a unique opportunity for each state to evaluate the comprehensive nature of their air medical services. The concept ""the golden hour"" has been molded into the world's premier public service aviation unit, which has proudly served the citizens of Maryland for over 24 years. This effort was initially made possible through a cooperative effort between the Maryland State Police Aviation Division and Dr. R Adams Cowley at the University of Maryland Hospital as a public service to the citizens of the state. This arrangement added a unique, economical, and life-saving component to the regionalized Emergency Medical Services and Critical Care system coordinated by the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems (MIESS). The Maryland State Police Aviation Division has four components: (1) aircraft, (2) state troopers, (3) system communications (SYSCOM) center, and (4) level I adult and pediatric trauma centers, as well as a regional burn center. ADAMS is a compilation of information of Air Medical Services in the United States to respond to traumas and other emergencies. Specifically, ADAMS provides descriptive and geographic information on Air Medical Service base locations, communication centers, rotor wing (RW) assets, and the major hospitals and transports that receive scene transports. The database includes all types of provider organizations including nonprofit, commercial, and public service (fire, police) air medical service providers, as well as several military units that routinely provide transport in remote areas. ADAMS provides national and statewide maps indicating air transport systems, trauma centers, and geographic population density. To provide a greater perspective on emergency medical care in individual states using the carefully tabulated ADAMS data, we compared the air emergency medical systems in Maryland to those of Oregon. Regardless of population density, Maryland provides air medical transport throughout the entire state, with the exception of only three small geographic areas. Maryland's 15 helicopter bases provide quick access for the seriously injured patient to either a Level I or pediatric trauma center within the ""golden hour."" In contrast, the air medical transportation system in Oregon is restricted to only three small geographic regions, making it an invitation to death for many seriously injured patients. It should be a federal mandate that the injured patient should gain access either by air transport or ambulance service to a Level I trauma center within that ""golden hour."" This federal legislation should include new criteria to initiate the dispatch of a helicopter to the scene of an accident or injury.",2020-05-01T17:18:50.228295,pubmed,2,41297346,1072915200,Maryland State Police Aviation Division. a Model Emergency Medical System for our Nation,401-14,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,journal-of-long-term-effects-of-medical-implants,J Long Term Eff Med Implants,Journal of Long-Term Effects of Medical Implants,1588353530,14,1,Richard F Edlich,2,John R Wish,2004-01-01T00:00:00,1588353530,maryland-state-police-aviation-division-a-model-emergency-medical-system-for-our-nation,journal-article,journal article,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,15479154,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1615/jlongtermeffmedimplants.v14.i5.60,2020-05-01T17:18:50.228295,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S Kagamimori,T Katoh,"Following the promotion of anti-air pollution measures in steam power stations using crude oil, atmospheric concentrations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulates have declined. These changes in atmospheric concentrations were accompanied by a decline in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among schoolchildren living near the power stations. In analysing the correlation between air pollutant concentrations and the prevalence of respiratory symptoms, those with positive skin reactions to house dust extract (the positive group) showed a more significant correlation coefficient compared to those who had never had a positive skin reaction (the negative group). In addition, schoolchildren more heavily exposed to air pollutants showed the higher prevalence of respiratory symptoms than the others. With regard to the kind of air pollutants, both sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide were more closely associated with the prevalence of respiratory symptoms than suspended particulates.

L Vinay,F Clarac,"The in vitro brain stem-spinal cord preparation of neonatal (0- to five-day-old) rats was used to establish whether pathways descending from the brain stem are capable of modulating synaptic transmission from primary afferents to lumbar motoneurons within the first few days after birth. We stimulated the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord at the cervical (C1-C2) level. Single-pulse stimulations evoked both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in ipsilateral lumbar (L2-L5) motoneurons which were recorded intracellularly. Twin-pulse stimulations evoked bursts of action potentials in ventral roots. The amplitude of the monosynaptic dorsal root-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential decreased when a conditioning stimulation was applied to the ventral funiculus 50-300 ms prior to the stimulation of the ipsilateral dorsal root. A decreased input resistance of the motoneurons during the early part (25-100 ms after the artifact) of the ventral funiculus-evoked postsynaptic potentials could account, at least partly, for the decreased amplitude of the dorsal root-evoked response. However, the duration of the inhibition of the dorsal root-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potential was longer than that of the decrease in input resistance. Ventral funiculus stimulation evoked antidromic discharges in dorsal roots. Recordings of dorsal root potentials showed that these discharges were generated by the underlying afferent terminal depolarizations reaching firing threshold. The dorsal root discharge overlapped with most of the time-course of the ventral funiculus-evoked inhibition of the response to dorsal root stimulation, suggesting that part of this inhibition may be exerted at a presynaptic level. The number of antidromic action potentials evoked in dorsal roots by ventral funiculus stimulation increased significantly in saline solution with chloride concentration reduced to 50% of control. Bursts of action potentials disappeared when chloride was removed completely. Antidromic discharges were therefore due to chloride conductance. The number of action potentials evoked in ventral roots was increased in low-chloride saline solutions. Removing chloride from the bathing solution resulted in an unstable ventral root activity. Bath application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (5-10 microM), blocked the ventral funiculus-evoked antidromic discharges in the dorsal roots. The increase in chloride conductance which generated the depolarizations underlying the dorsal root discharges was therefore mediated by an activation of GABA(A) receptors. In contrast, bursts of action potentials in the ventral roots were increased in both amplitude and duration under bicuculline. Our data demonstrate that pathways running in the ventral funiculus of the spinal cord exert a control on interneurons mediating presynaptic inhibition at birth.",2020-05-01T03:24:02.450792,pubmed,2,35431823,922924800,Antidromic Discharges of Dorsal Root Afferents and Inhibition of the Lumbar Monosynaptic Reflex in the Neonatal Rat,165-76,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0306-4522,neuroscience,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,1588303442,90,1,L Vinay,2,F Clarac,1999-04-01T00:00:00,1588303442,antidromic-discharges-of-dorsal-root-afferents-and-inhibition-of-the-lumbar-monosynaptic-reflex-in-the-neonatal-rat,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00435-7,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,10188943,2020-05-01T03:24:02.450792,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,204,1.484,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,pii,,S0306-4522(98)00435-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
N Ohtsu,R L Ariagno,"The effect of dexamethasone (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg/d given subcutaneously from d 14-18) was tested in infant mice continuously exposed from birth to either humidified air or 80% oxygen.

Dexamethasone, however, had no effect on lung compliance measured after animals were killed on d 18. It also had no effect on the increase in the blood-air barrier thickness or decrease in the blood-air exchange surface area seen in the 80% oxygen-exposed mice.

V Codjia,W Mulatu,"In July 1989, blood samples were collected from parasitaemic cattle in the Ghibe valley, Ethiopia, frozen in liquid nitrogen and transported to Nairobi, Kenya. Twelve of the stabilates were inoculated into individual Boran (Bos indicus) calves and characterised for their sensitivity, in turn, to diminazene aceturate (Berenil), isometamidium chloride (Samorin) and homidium chloride (Novidium). All 12 stabilates produced infections which were shown to be Trypanosoma congolense and resistant to treatment with diminazene aceturate at a dose of 7.0 mg kg-1 body weight (b.w.). Eleven of the infections were also resistant to isometamidium chloride at a dose of 0.5 mg kg-1 b.w. and homidium chloride at a dose of 1.0 mg kg-1 b.w. The drug-sensitivity phenotypes of three of the same isolates were also determined in goats which were each treated with only one of the three trypanocides: all expressed the same phenotypes as the populations expressed in the aforementioned Boran calves. Five clones were derived from one of the isolates which expressed a high level of resistance to all three trypanocides; each clone expressed high levels of resistance to all three trypanocides when characterised in mice. Thus, the multi-resistance phenotype of the parental isolate was associated with expression of mutli-resistance by individual trypanosomes. Finally, molecular karyotypes and electrophoretic variants of six enzymes were determined for seven and eight of the isolates, respectively. Six different karyotypes were observed and all eight of the latter isolates belonged to different zymodemes, indicating that the multi-resistance phenotype at Ghibe was associated with many genetically distinct populations.",2020-05-01T00:02:45.731119,pubmed,8,33951487,733622400,"Epidemiology of Bovine Trypanosomiasis in the Ghibe Valley, Southwest Ethiopia. 3.

H Craig,H Shoji,"""Craigite,"" the mixed-air clathrate hydrate found in polar ice caps below the depth of air-bubble stability, is a clathrate mixed crystal of approximate composition (N2O2).6H2O. Recent observations on the Byrd Station Antarctic core show that the air hydrate is present at a depth of 727 m, well above the predicted depth for the onset of hydrate stability. We propose that the air hydrate occurs some 100 m above the equilibrium phase boundary at Byrd Station because of ""piezometry""--i.e., that the anomalous depth of hydrate occurrence is a relic of a previous greater equilibrium depth along the flow trajectory, followed by vertical advection of ice through the local phase-boundary depth. Flowline trajectories in the ice based on numerical models show that the required vertical displacement does indeed occur just upstream of Byrd Station. Air-hydrate piezometry can thus be used as a general parameter to study the details of ice flow in polar ice caps and the metastable persistence of the clathrate phase in regions of upwelling blue ice.",2020-05-01T06:45:30.954246,pubmed,3,36844944,754704000,Nonequilibrium Air Clathrate Hydrates in Antarctic Ice: a Paleopiezomdter for Polar Ice Caps,11416-8,23,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0027-8424,proceedings-of-the-national-academy-of-sciences-of-the-united-states-of-america,Proc.

C C Vaughn,E Wolner,Prolonged air leak after a lung volume reduction operation for pulmonary emphysema is a major cause of morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. Staple line reinforcement is recognized as an effective adjunctive technique for decreasing the occurrence of air leaks after pulmonary wedge resection. Numerous materials have been used for staple-line reinforcement. We use expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sleeves that fit over the arms of surgical staplers to facilitate staple-line reinforcement in both thoracoscopic and open lung volume reduction procedures. The expanded polytetrafluoroethylene sleeves do not require rinsing or special handling; they are easy to use and effective in preventing air leaks.

S Iurato,G Marioni,"Cumulative data from several authors show that -50% of patients undergoing partial ossiculoplasty have a postoperative air-bone gap of 0 to 10 dB, and 80% have a postoperative air-bone gap of 0 to 20 dB. Equally good results may be achieved with autograft (no difference was found between interposition of the incus or the head of the malleus), homograft, or alloplastic partial prostheses. With alloplastic total prostheses, 36% of patients have a postoperative air-bone gap of 0 to 10 dB, and 74% have a postoperative air-bone gap of 0 to 20 dB. When success was defined as a postoperative air-bone gap within 10 dB, the success rate was higher for myringoplasty (81%) than for ossiculoplasty (55%). When success was defined as a postoperative air-bone gap within 20 dB, the success rate was 97% in myringoplasties and 85% in ossiculoplasties. There was no significant deterioration over time of the mean postoperative air-bone gap for any frequency. This study complies with levels 1 and 2 of the guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (1995).

W Dong,J Lewtas,"The effects of urban air and diesel particles on inflammatory cytokine gene expression, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in particular, were studied in rat alveolar macrophages. TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2 gene expression and TNF-alpha secretion were increased in cells treated with 50 to 200 micrograms/mL of urban air particles in a concentration-related manner. There was no cytokine induction by diesel particles at any of the concentrations tested. Cytokine expression was not related to reactive oxygen species since antioxidants, such as catalase, TMTU, or DMSO, had no effect on TNF-alpha secretion. However, cytokine induction by urban air particles was completely prevented by polymyxin B, an antibiotic capable of neutralizing bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activities. Furthermore, LPS was detected on the urban air particles, but not on diesel particle. These results suggest that activation of cytokine gene expression and secretion in rat alveolar macrophages by urban air particles is due to the presence of endotoxin on the particles.",2020-05-01T02:35:40.444648,pubmed,3,35051326,,Role of Endotoxin in Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Expression from Alveolar Macrophages Treated with Urban Air Particles,577-92,5,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0190-2148,experimental-lung-research,Exp.

D Cotterrell,R Whittam,"1. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate has been studied in human red cells, ghosts and haemoglobin-free membranes to see whether hydrolysis was related to the functioning of the sodium pump.2. The cell membrane restricted p-nitrophenyl phosphate entry into cells and was rate-limiting for hydrolysis by the large amount of intracellular soluble phosphatase. The uptake was inversely proportional to the external chloride concentration, and inhibitors (phloretin and persantin) of inorganic phosphate uptake also reduced p-nitrophenyl phosphate uptake and hydrolysis. The entry mechanism of p-nitrophenyl phosphate appears to be similar to that of inorganic phosphate.3. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate was hydrolysed in cells almost entirely by ouabain-insensitive phosphatases, both soluble and membrane bound. In ghosts containing less soluble enzyme than cells there was still no component of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis that was related to the sodium pump in being sensitive to external potassium or ouabain.4. Haemoglobin-free membranes lacking soluble p-nitrophenyl phosphatase required potassium for optimum p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis and this part was inhibited by ouabain as was also ATP hydrolysis by the sodium pump. The rates of potassium-dependent and potassium-independent hydrolysis were each increased about threefold on decreasing the electrolyte concentration from 150 to 25 mM. The response was found whether the main electrolyte was potassium chloride, sodium chloride, choline chloride or Tris chloride. In contrast, the changes were not found when the osmotic pressure was varied to the same extent with non-electrolytes. p-Nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis was thus activated on lowering the ionic strength. The soluble enzyme was similarly affected and the effect was reversible.5. The membrane ATPase activity was unaffected by the changes in ionic strength which markedly altered p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis.6. These results with red cell membranes show that the ionic strength under physiological conditions largely prevents the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate, but not of ATP. A possible mechanism is discussed in terms of the effect of different structures of water in electrolyte and non-electrolyte solutions on the enzymic activity of the sodium pump.",2020-04-30T19:53:15.452865,pubmed,2,30359976,76204800,The Uptake and Hydrolysis of P-Nitrophenyl Phosphate by Red Cells in Relation to Atp Hydrolysis by the Sodium Pump,773-802,3,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-3751,the-journal-of-physiology,J.

H W Schlipköter,K Beyen,"Air pollutants can exhibit both acute and chronic effects. Acute effects mainly occur during smog situations in industrial areas when atmospheric concentrations of hazardous substances are extremely high. This leads to an increase of morbidity and mortality especially in old and ill people. Chronic effects are the consequence of a longlasting exposition to low doses of noxious substances. Epidemiological studies have shown that frequency of respiratory diseases is higher in air polluted areas; this effect is particularly evident in smokers. Biological monitoring is used to determine the individual heavy metal burden. Lead is a danger especially for the developing central nervous system. Cadmium accumulates in the renal cortex during lifetime and may cause disturbances of renal function if a certain concentration is reached. The risk groups for heavy metals are young children and pregnant women in the case of lead and old people in the case of cadmium, respectively. Lung cancer incidence is higher in large cities than in rural areas. Carcinogenicity of city smog extracts was proved in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that urban air pollution may play a role as a causal factor in respiratory cancer.",2020-04-30T19:18:32.829502,pubmed,2,29265979,504921600,Health Effects of Air Pollutants,3-8,1,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0303-8408,sozial-und-praventivmedizin,Soz Praventivmed,Sozial- Und Praventivmedizin,1588274312,31,1,H W Schlipköter,2,K Beyen,1986-01-01T00:00:00,1588274312,health-effects-of-air-pollutants,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/bf02103736,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,3962500,2020-04-30T19:18:32.829502,english-abstract,english abstract,,,english-abstract,english abstract,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R P Angle,H S Sandhu,"Traditional air resource management systems have difficulty in addressing global issues, sustainable development, direct citizen participation, and integration with broad economic interests. As reactive management systems, they tend to be compliance-driven, static, and rigid. In contrast, proactive management systems are principle-driven, innovative, and flexible. Bridge scientists play a key role in supporting the transformation of raw data into wise action. Decision-makers need to integrate social values with knowledge about emissions, atmospheric processes, and potential environmental effects using the primary tools of measurements, monitoring, and modeling. The Alberta Clean Air Strategic Alliance, a unique partnership of governments, industry, and public interest groups formed in 1994, operates a comprehensive air management system that is capable of addressing air issues of greater complexity and uncertainty.

Przemysław Wierzbicki,Monika Prokopiuk-Wierzbicka,"Our preliminary results show, for the first time in the literature, that occurrence of FA damage might occur rather often in HD pts qualified for this procedure from cardiological point of view. Pseudoaneurysms of FA, being in our material the most frequent pathology, should be promptly diagnosed with colour duplex USG and subsequently treated non surgically with USG guided controlled compression. In 21 pts we found no local complications. In 16 of 37 pts 7 hematomas (HM) and 9 femoral pseudoaneurysms (FPA) were found. All HM were treated conservatively. From 9 FPA cases, 2 thrombosed spontaneously and the remaining 7 pts were treated firstly with USG guided controlled compression (UGCC). UGCC resulted in successful thrombosis of FPA in 3 pts with mean volume of FPA 40 +/- 12 ml but failed in 4 other pts with mean volume of FPA 39 +/- 17 ml. From the group of 340 HD patients in our Centre in years 1996-2003 37 consecutive HD patients (23M, 14F, aged 55, 5 +/- 8, 2years, on HD 24, 2 +/- 22,6 months) after FAC, indicated from cardiological point of view, underwent regular femoral colour duplex USG. Patients undergoing chronic haemodialysis (HD) therapy have higher risk of arterial injury during cannulation for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.

Z H Abraham,D J Lowe,"Dissimilatory nitrite reductase was isolated from extracts of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans subsp. xylosoxidans (N.C.I.M.B. 11015), after activation of crude extracts by the addition of copper(II) sulphate. The enzyme was purified by a combination of (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and cationic-exchange chromatography to 93% homogeneity as judged by SDS/PAGE. SDS/PAGE and spray m.s. showed that the enzyme had a subunit M(r) of 36.5 kDa. The copper content was 3.5 +/- 0.8 Cu atoms/trimer of M(r) 109,500. E.p.r. spectroscopy of nitrite reductase as isolated showed that both type 1 (g parallel = 2.208, A parallel = 6.3 mT) and type 2 (g parallel = 2.298, A parallel = 14.2 mT) Cu centres were present, in contrast with published data [Masuko, Iwasaki, Sakurai, Suzuki and Nakahara (1984) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 96, 447-454], where only type 1 copper centres were reported. Our preparations had a specific activity of 150-300 mumol of NO2- reduced/min per mg of protein, 6-12-fold higher than reported previously. As isolated, the oxidized form of our preparations of the enzyme showed absorption maxima in the visible region at 460, 593 and 770 nm. The ratio of the absorption bands at 460 nm and 593 nm resulted in this protein having a strong blue colour, in contrast with the green colour of other purified copper-containing nitrite reductases.

Chang-Hwan Bae,Fumio Koyama,"We demonstrate a novel hollow waveguide optical switch composed of an multi-mode interference (MMI) coupler with a variable air core. The numerical simulation and experiment of the proposed optical switch is carried out for investigating the operation of the switch. Switching operation can be obtained by the mechanical displacement of the air core of an MMI hollow waveguide. A hollow waveguide consists of Au mirrors deposited on two GaAs substrates for optical confinement. The measured result shows a possibility of switching of about 85% optical power fraction with a switch length of 1.1 mm and small displacement (DeltaDcore=3 mum) of an air core thickness.

Nils L L Steyaert,Mara Hauck,"A model was developed for gaseous plant-air exchange of semi-volatile organic compounds. Based on previous soil-plant modelling, uptake and elimination kinetics were scaled as a function of plant mass and octanol-air partition ratios. Exchange of chemicals was assumed to be limited by resistances encountered during diffusion through a laminar boundary layer of air and permeation through the cuticle of the leaf. The uptake rate constant increased and the elimination rate constant decreased with the octanol-air partition ratio both apparently levelling off at high values. Differences in kinetics between species could be explained by their masses. Validation on independent data showed that bio-concentration factors of PCBs, chlorobenzenes and other chemicals were predicted well by the model. For pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins deviations occurred.",2020-05-02T02:29:12.747700,fris,4,44974360,1254355200,Modelling Bioaccumulation of Semi-Volatile Organic Compounds (Socs) from Air in Plants Based on Allometric Principles,727 - 732,6,fris,journal-article,journal article,0045-6535,chemosphere,Chemosphere,Chemosphere,1588386552,77,1,Nils L L Steyaert,2,Mara Hauck,2009-10-01T00:00:00,1588386552,modelling-bioaccumulation-of-semi-volatile-organic-compounds-socs-from-air-in-plants-based-on-allometric-principles,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2009.08.032,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,19766288,2020-05-02T02:29:12.747700,,,,,,,,,Stijn W H Van Hulle,A Jan Hendriks,,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,Radboud University Nijmegen,Catholic University of Nijmegen,Ru Kdc,radboud-universiteit,Radboud Universiteit,212,1.448,academic,Europe,NL,Netherlands,Radboud University Nijmegen,Catholic University of Nijmegen,Ru Kdc,radboud-universiteit,Radboud Universiteit,3,Stijn W H Van Hulle,4,A Jan Hendriks,,,,,,,,TRUE,56432,Stijn Van Hulle,stijn-van-hulle,,wosuid,wosuid: Web of Science™ identifier,271301300004,Radboud Universiteit Instituut Voor Toegepaste Sociale Wetenschappen,Radboud Universiteit Instituut Voor Toegepaste Sociale Wetenschappen,,,,,,,,Ru its,Ru its,,,,,,,,,,,,Belgium,liwet-laboratory-of-industrial-water-and-ecotechnology,Liwet - Laboratory of Industrial Water and Ecotechnology,,,,liwet-laboratory-of-industrial-water-and-ecotechnology,Liwet - Laboratory of Industrial Water and Ecotechnology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,kinetics,atmospheric deposition,persistent organic pollutants,accumulation,body mass,polychlorinatedbiphenyls,kinetics,kinetics,atmospheric-deposition,atmospheric deposition,persistent-organic-pollutants,persistent organic pollutants,accumulation,accumulation,body-mass,body mass,polychlorinatedbiphenyls,polychlorinatedbiphenyls,,,,,TRUE,56432,Stijn Van Hulle,stijn-van-hulle,stijn-van-hulle,Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,Katholieke Universiteit Nijmegen,Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen,,,,,dibenzopdioxins,bioconcentration,polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons,dibenzopdioxins,dibenzopdioxins,bioconcentration,bioconcentration,polycyclic-aromatichydrocarbons,polycyclic aromatichydrocarbons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Radboud University,,,,,Radboud University,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,fris,,cbee59f7-c5a8-4376-8257-01e81fc7c718,academic,Europe,BE,Belgium,State University of Ghent,University of Ghent,Ugent,Ghent University,universiteit-gent,Universiteit Gent,pubmed,interspecies variability,chemical vapors,octanolwater partitioncoefficients,foliage,spruce needles,interspecies-variability,interspecies variability,chemical-vapors,chemical vapors,octanolwater-partitioncoefficients,octanolwater partitioncoefficients,foliage,foliage,spruce-needles,spruce needles,pubmed,academic,Europe,BE,Belgium,State University of Ghent,University of Ghent,Ugent,Ghent University,universiteit-gent,Universiteit Gent,pii,S0045-6535(09)00984-9,handle,handle: Handle,1854/LU-808683
D Schwela,,"This article discusses the impact of cooking stoves in developing countries on indoor air quality and human health. About 50% of the world's households rely on wood, stubble, dung, and grass for cooking fuel. These products are burned in open fires and inefficient stoves in poorly ventilated rooms. Biomass smoke contains many harmful pollutants, such as particles and carbon monoxide. Coal smoke contains sulphur and nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons that can cause cancer. Biomass smoke can cause acute respiratory infections. Women and children receive the highest exposure to biomass smoke. About 2500 million people are exposed to excessive levels of indoor air pollution, of which most is due to burning biomass and coal indoors with poor ventilation. About 1.9 million deaths annually are attributed to rural indoor air pollution from suspended particulate matter. About 450,000 deaths annually are attributed to urban indoor air pollution. An additional 500,000 deaths are attributed to other suspended particulate matter and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere. Particulate suspensions in the air are especially problematic in rural African countries and rural India. Particulates are acutely problematic in urban Latin America, India, and China. One study in The Gambia found that girls younger than 5 who were around mothers who were cooking had a 6-times higher risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI) than those around parents who smoked cigarettes.

Stina Marntell,Görel Nyman,"In healthy horses undergoing short-term dissociative anaesthesia, air breathing ensures a level of oxygen delivery that meets tissue demand. There is no benefit to horses in breathing O2-rich gas after the gas supply is discontinued. On the contrary, the degree of shunt induced by breathing O2-rich gas persists. The clinical relevance of this during recovery requires investigation. During dissociative anaesthesia, arterial oxygenation was greater when horses breathed gas containing more than 95% oxygen, compared with when they breathed air. However, breathing O2-rich gas increased intrapulmonary shunt and caused hypoventilation. The intrapulmonary shunt created during anaesthesia by high inspired O2 concentrations remained larger when FIO2 was reduced to 0.21, indicating that absorption atelectasis produced during O2-rich gas breathing persisted throughout anaesthesia. Breathing O2-rich gas was associated with a decreased respiratory rate (p = 0.015) increased PaCO2 (p < 0.001) and increased PaO2 (p = 0.004) compared with breathing air. All horses developed intrapulmonary shunt during anaesthesia, but shunt was significantly greater (13 +/- 5%) when O2-rich gas was delivered compared with air breathing (5 +/- 2%; p = 0.013). Ten minutes after O2-rich gas was replaced by air, shunt remained larger in horses that had initially received oxygen compared with those breathing air (p = 0.042). Mixed venous oxygen tensions were significantly lower during sedation than at baseline (p < 0.001) and during anaesthesia (p < 0.001). Horses were anaesthetized on two occasions with tiletamine-zolazepam after pre-anaesthetic medication with acepromazine, romifidine and butorphanol. After endotracheal intubation and positioning in left lateral recumbency, animals were allowed to breathe spontaneously. One of two, randomly allocated inspired gas treatments was provided: either i) room air (fractional concentration of inspired O2 [FIO2] = 0.21) provided throughout anaesthesia; or ii) an O2-rich gas mixture (FIO2 = >0.95) for 15 minutes, followed by room air. The alternative treatment was delivered at the second anaesthetic. Respiratory and haemodynamic variables and the distribution of ventilation-perfusion (VA/Q) ratios (using the multiple inert gas elimination technique) were determined in the standing conscious horse (baseline) after sedation and during anaesthesia.

Sukhvinder S Obhi,Jeremy Hogeveen,"Similar circuits in the brain are engaged during the performance and observation of identical actions. Such engagement manifests in priming effects, where observation of an action leads to faster production of that action and slower production of an action involving a different movement of the same effector (e.g. observed finger flexion vs. produced finger extension), or a completely different effector (e.g. observed hand action vs. produced leg action). Here, we asked whether priming occurs for actions involving identical muscle groups where the degree of muscle contraction in observed actions was the same or different to that underlying an instructed response and whether patterns of muscle activation were also affected. Participants held an unseen rubber ball between their forefinger and thumb and responded to colour cues instructing a hard or a soft squeeze, whilst EMG activity from the first dorsal interosseous and the abductor pollicis brevis was recorded. The colour cues were superimposed on videos depicting a hard or soft squeeze of an identical rubber ball. Thus, there were two congruent (observe hard, produce hard; observe soft, produce soft) and two incongruent (observe hard, produce soft; observe soft, produce hard) conditions. Results showed that reaction time was slowed and EMG activity was modulated in the direction of the difference between observed and instructed squeezing movements. Hence, neural circuits underlying action observation are sensitive not only to differences in the actual muscle groups underlying observed actions but also to different extents of activation of the same muscle groups.",2020-05-02T02:33:39.724179,pubmed,2,45019194,1275350400,Incidental Action Observation Modulates Muscle Activity,427-35,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0014-4819,experimental-brain-research,Exp Brain Res,Experimental Brain Research,1588386819,203,1,Sukhvinder S Obhi,2,Jeremy Hogeveen,2010-06-01T00:00:00,1588386819,incidental-action-observation-modulates-muscle-activity,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.1007/s00221-010-2253-z,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,20454787,2020-05-02T02:33:39.724179,,,,,,,,,,,,academic,Americas,CA,Canada,Wlu,,,wilfrid-laurier-university,Wilfrid Laurier University,156,0.899,academic,Americas,CA,Canada,Wlu,,,wilfrid-laurier-university,Wilfrid Laurier University,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,787568,Jeremy Hogeveen,jeremy-hogeveen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,787568,Jeremy Hogeveen,jeremy-hogeveen,jeremy-hogeveen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H I Sati,M Greaves,"Interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are potent bone resorbing cytokines that may contribute to the development of the osteolytic bone disease observed in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Although these factors have been identified in cultures of bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from patients, the identity of the cells responsible for producing IL-1beta and TNFalpha remains unclear. Using a sensitive dual-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique and a two-colour immunofluorescence method we have investigated the expression of the mRNA and protein, for IL-1beta and TNFalpha, by individual bone marrow plasma cells from patients with MM and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). The mRNA for IL-1beta and TNFalpha was identified in all cells expressing the immunoglobulin light chain from all patients with MM and MGUS. However, the IL-1beta protein could not be detected in cytoplasmic light chain positive cells in any of the patients examined. In contrast, the TNFalpha protein was detected in clonal plasma cells from patients with both MM and MGUS. Interestingly, the IL-1beta and TNFalpha mRNA and proteins were readily detected within a small proportion of the non-plasma cells from patients with both MM and MGUS. These data suggest that myeloma cells in vivo are able to produce TNFalpha but not IL-1beta. In addition, a small proportion of accessory cells are likely to be able to contribute to the production of both ILbeta and TNFalpha.",2020-05-01T03:35:23.031437,pubmed,5,35523265,917827200,Expression of Interleukin-1Beta and Tumour Necrosis Factor-Alpha in Plasma Cells from Patients with Multiple Myeloma,350-7,2,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0007-1048,british-journal-of-haematology,Br.

Palash Mandal,Sanjoy Roychowdhury,"Alcoholic liver disease is mediated via activation of TLR4 signaling; MyD88-dependent and -independent signals are important contributors to injury in mouse models. Adiponectin, an anti-inflammatory adipokine, suppresses TLR4/MyD88-dependent responses via induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Here we investigated the interactions between chronic ethanol, adiponectin, and HO-1 in regulation of TLR4/MyD88-independent signaling in macrophages and an in vivo mouse model. After chronic ethanol feeding, LPS-stimulated expression of IFN-β and CXCL10 mRNA was increased in primary cultures of Kupffer cells compared with pair-fed control mice. Treatment of Kupffer cells with globular adiponectin (gAcrp) normalized this response. LPS-stimulated IFN-β/CXCL10 mRNA and CXCL10 protein was also reduced in RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with gAcrp or full-length adiponectin. gAcrp and full-length adiponectin acted via adiponectin receptors 1 and 2, respectively. gAcrp decreased TLR4 expression in both Kupffer cells and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Small interfering RNA knockdown of HO-1 or inhibition of HO-1 activity with zinc protoporphyrin blocked these effects of gAcrp. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to chronic ethanol feeding, with or without treatment with cobalt protoporphyrin, to induce HO-1. After chronic ethanol feeding, mice were sensitized to in vivo challenge with LPS, expressing increased IFN-β/CXCL10 mRNA and CXCL10 protein in liver compared with control mice. Pretreatment with cobalt protoporphyrin 24 h before LPS challenge normalized this effect of ethanol. Adiponectin and induction of HO-1 potently suppressed TLR4-dependent/MyD88-independent cytokine expression in primary Kupffer cells from rats and in mouse liver after chronic ethanol exposure. These data suggest that induction of HO-1 may be a useful therapeutic strategy in alcoholic liver disease.",2020-05-02T02:40:03.710069,pubmed,6,45084473,1287100800,Adiponectin and Heme Oxygenase-1 Suppress Tlr4/Myd88-Independent Signaling in Rat Kupffer Cells and in Mice after Chronic Ethanol Exposure,4928-37,8,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,0022-1767,journal-of-immunology-baltimore-md-1950,J.

T Van Der Touw,Y Mudaliar,"The results suggest that manual compression of the rib cage during consecutive tidal expirations would be ineffective in reducing pulmonary hyperinflation during the emergency management of asthma when air flow obstruction is so severe that ventilation cannot be achieved by positive-pressure ventilation.

Playback of the recorded data enabled measurement of changes in lung volume (air flow integration). Changes during rib cage compression consisted chiefly of small decreases in lung volume and peak inspiratory airway pressure that were only observed in the least obstructed patient and were fully reversed after the cessation of compressions.

L A Corner,A C Trajstman,"The majority of tissue specimens submitted for the isolation of Mycobacterium bovis contain contaminating microorganisms and therefore require selective decontamination before bacteriological examination. The purpose of this study was to identify the preferred decontaminant amongst four commonly used reagents. The four decontaminants used in the study were 1-hexadecylpyridinium chloride, sodium hydroxide, benzalkonium chloride and oxalic acid. A comparison was made of the toxicity of the four decontaminants for M. bovis and their ability to control contamination. Used at the recommended concentrations, all reagents showed a significant degree of toxicity. The toxicity of the decontaminants for three field strains and one laboratory strain of M. bovis were similar, but a second laboratory strain, AN5, was more susceptible. It was also observed that as the concentration of each reagent decreased an abrupt change from control to lack of control of contaminating micro-organisms occurred. Hexadecylpyridinium chloride was found to be the best all-round reagent because at concentrations that effectively controlled contamination this reagent was the least toxic to M. bovis.

The LAF-unit has a central zone with an airflow of 0.4 m/s and a peripheral zone with an airflow of 0.2 m/s. The design provides an exponential downflow of air resembling an upside-down trumpet mouth and it was claimed to prevent entrainment of peripheral contaminated air. The unit was evaluated with regard to elimination of particles with focus on bacteria-carrying particles (colony-forming units = cfu) during rigidly standardized sham operations. Three different lengths of walls/enclosures (short-ending 2.0 m, medium 1.0 m and long 0.2 m above the floor) were tested. It provided a high degree of bacteriological cleanliness (0.05-4 cfu/m3 of air and 7-64 cfu/m2/h surface contamination) and its efficiency was proved to be independent of the length of the enclosures. We conclude that the novel zoned ultraclean vertical LAF unit is versatile, as it allows for omitting long side-walls, without compromising bacteriological safety.",2020-05-01T02:12:46.553298,pubmed,3,34885700,849398400,Zoned Vertical Ultraclean Operating Room Ventilation. a Novel Concept Making Long side Walls Unnecessary,578-82,6,pubmed,journal-article,journal article,,acta-orthopaedica-scandinavica,Acta Orthop Scand,Acta Orthopaedica Scandinavica,1588299166,67,1,B E Friberg,2,S Friberg,1996-12-01T00:00:00,1588299166,zoned-vertical-ultraclean-operating-room-ventilation-a-novel-concept-making-long-side-walls-unnecessary,journal-article,journal article,https://doi.org/,doi,doi: Digital object identifier,10.3109/17453679608997760,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/,pmid,pmid: PubMed Unique Identifier,9065071,2020-05-01T02:12:46.553298,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,research-support-nonus-govt,research support nonus govt,,,L G Burman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,L G Burman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
